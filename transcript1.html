DECEMBER 31ST, 2031. SUPERVISOR MAHMOOD THANK YOU<br>
<br>
PRESIDENT AND COLLEAGUES I WANT TO BEGIN ON THIS ORDINANCE BY<br>
<br>
RECOGNIZING THE STRONG AND UNITED COMMUNITIES SUPPORT<br>
<br>
WE JUST SAW OUTSIDE AT A PRESS CONFERENCE STEPS AWAY.<br>
<br>
THAT MOMENT UNDERSCORED WHAT THIS LEGISLATION IS REALLY ABOUT SHOWING THAT SAN FRANCISCO CAN COME TOGETHER<br>
<br>
ACROSS NEIGHBORHOODS, BACKGROUNDS AND SECTORS TO<br>
<br>
BUILD A SMARTER, FAIRER AND MORE COMPASSIONATE APPROACH<br>
<br>
TO HOMELESSNESS. >> WE HEARD FROM LABOR UNIONS,<br>
<br>
BUSINESS LEADERS, POLITICAL LEADERS AND COMMUNITY ADVOCATES<br>
<br>
MANY OF WHOM HAVE EXPERIENCED FIRSTHAND HOW OUR CURRENT<br>
<br>
SYSTEM STRAINS ALREADY BURDENED NEIGHBORHOODS WHILE LEAVING<br>
<br>
OTHERS BEHIND. >> THAT'S WHY WE'RE PROUD TO BRING THIS ORDINANCE FORWARD WITH THE SUPPORT OF A BROAD<br>
<br>
AND DIVERSE COALITION WHO ALL AGREE WE NEED A MORE BALANCED<br>
<br>
DATA INFORMED SYSTEM OF CARE THAT MEETS PEOPLE WHERE THEY<br>
<br>
ARE AND HELPS COMMUNITIES THRIVE.<br>
<br>
>> OUR COMMUNITY AND ORGANIZATIONAL SPONSORS INCLUDE CODE TENDERLOIN, TENDERLOIN.<br>

<br>
SHARED BELIEF THAT NEIGHBORHOODS DESERVE A VOICE<br>
<br>
IN SHAPING HOW SERVICES ARE DELIVERED.<br>
<br>
>> AND THAT PARTNERSHIP NOT SURPRISE IS THE PATH TO<br>
<br>
SUCCESSFUL SUSTAINABLE SOLUTION.<br>
<br>
THIS ORDINANCE REFLECTS THE YEARS OF ADVOCACY, ADVOCACY AND A COLLECTIVE EFFORT TO STRENGTHEN THE FABRIC OF OUR<br>
<br>
MOST IMPACTED COMMUNITIES. >> THE ONE CITY SHELTER ACT IS<br>
<br>
ROOTED IN A SIMPLE BUT LONG OVERDUE PRINCIPLE THAT EVERY<br>
<br>
NEIGHBORHOOD SHOULD BE PART OF THE SOLUTION AND EVERY SAN<br>
<br>
FRANCISCAN SHOULD HAVE ACCESS TO SHELTER AND CARE NO MATTER<br>
<br>
WHERE THEY LIVE. >> FOR TOO LONG WE'VE RELIED ON<br>
<br>
REACTIVE AND CRISIS DRIVEN PLANNING. IT'S LED TO A HARMFUL OVERCONCENTRATION IN JUST A FEW<br>
<br>
NEIGHBORHOODS WHILE OTHERS HAVE REMAINED SERVICE DESERTS.<br>
<br>
>> THIS ORDINANCE AIMS TO BREAK THAT CYCLE.<br>
<br>
>> WHAT WE'RE BRINGING FORWARD TODAY IS THE MOST IMPLEMENTABLE DATA INFORMED VERSION OF THIS POLICY ONE THAT STRENGTHENS<br>
<br>
TRANSPARENCY, ALIGNS SERVICES WITH NEED AND ENSURES EARLY<br>
<br>
MEANINGFUL COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT.<br>
<br>
>> CURRENTLY 75% OF ALL SHELTER IN TRANSITIONAL HOUSING BEDS<br>
<br>
ARE CONCENTRATED IN JUST 30 NEIGHBORHOODS OR SORRY IN JUST<br>
<br>
EIGHT NEIGHBORHOODS WHILE MORE THAN 1000 UNSHELTERED RESIDENTS<br>
<br>
IN THE REMAINING 30 PLUS NEIGHBORHOODS HAVE NO NEARBY<br>
<br>
ACCESS TO CARE. >> THAT KIND OF IMBALANCE SENDS<br>
<br>
A MESSAGE WHETHER INTENTIONAL OR NOT THAT ONLY A FEW<br>
<br>
NEIGHBORHOODS ARE EXPECTED TO SHOULDER THE CITY'S RESPONSE TO<br>
<br>
A CITYWIDE CRISIS. >> IT CREATES A DYNAMIC WHERE<br>
<br>
NEIGHBORHOODS LIKE THE TENDERLOIN AND SOMA ARE CARRYING THE WEIGHT WHILE OTHERS ARE LEFT ON THE<br>
<br>
SIDELINES. >> THIS ORDINANCE IS ABOUT<br>
<br>
ZOOMING OUT, SHIFTING OUR PERSPECTIVE AND ADDRESSING OUR<br>
<br>
HOMELESSNESS RESPONSE THROUGH THE LENS OF ONE CITY WHERE<br>
<br>
EVERY NEIGHBORHOOD PLAYS A ROLE AND NO COMMUNITY IS LEFT BEHIND<br>
<br>
OR ASKED TO DO IT ALONE. >> THIS IS NOT ABOUT DRAWING LINES BETWEEN NEIGHBORHOODS. >> IT'S ABOUT DRAWING A CIRCLE<br>
<br>
THAT BRINGS EVERY NEIGHBORHOOD IN EQUITY ISN'T A ZERO SUM<br>
<br>
GAME. WHEN EACH PART OF THE CITY<br>
<br>
CONTRIBUTES, THE ENTIRE CITY BECOMES STRONGER, MORE<br>
<br>
RESILIENT AND MORE JUST. >> A BUDGET AND FINANCE<br>
<br>
COMMITTEE. WE MADE SEVERAL KEY AMENDMENTS BASED ON FEEDBACK FROM EXPERTS AND PARTNERS TO STRENGTHEN<br>
<br>
AND CLARIFY OUR EQUITY FRAMEWORK.<br>
<br>
WE CREATED A FIRST OF ITS KIND FAIR SHARE RULE.<br>
<br>
NEW CITY FUNDED SHELTERS CAN'T BE PURSUED IN NEIGHBORHOODS THAT HAVE ALREADY HAVE A HIGHER SHARE OF BEDS THAN THEIR SHARE<br>
<br>
OF UNSHELTERED POPULATION. >> UNLESS A WAIVER IS GRANTED<br>
<br>
WE WILL ALSO HAVE A 300 FOOT BUFFER BETWEEN NEW SHELTERS TO<br>
<br>
AVOID HYPER CLUSTERING AND PRESERVE NEIGHBORHOOD<br>
<br>
BALANCE. >> WE HAVE EXPECTATIONS FOR<br>
<br>
PROJECTS ALREADY IN THE PIPELINE OR EXEMPTION EXEMPTIONS FACILITY IS EXPANDING WITHIN EXISTING<br>
<br>
FOOTPRINT OR REPLACING CLOSED CLOSED SERVICES IN THE SAME<br>
<br>
NEIGHBORHOOD. WE CALL FOR A BIANNUAL EQUITY ANALYSIS AND REPORTING TO KEEP DECISIONS GROUNDED IN REAL TIME<br>
<br>
DATA AND FOR THE FIRST TIME PROVIDE TRANSPARENCY ABOUT<br>
<br>
WHERE THE CITY MIGHT BE CONSIDERING SITING SITES.<br>
<br>
>> AND WE WROTE A SUNSET DATE FOR 2031 TO ALLOW US TO TEST,<br>
<br>
EVALUATE AND ADJUST THIS LEGISLATION OVER TIME.<br>
<br>
>> IT'S IMPORTANT TO RECOGNIZE THAT THIS ORDINANCE IS NOT<br>
<br>
ABOUT SHIFTING BURDENS. >> IT'S ABOUT FINALLY BUILDING<br>
<br>
A BALANCED SYSTEM THAT SERVES ALL SAN FRANCISCANS AND THE<br>
<br>
TENDERLOIN. >> WE HAVE 3500 CHILDREN<br>
<br>
AND NOT A SINGLE TOY STORE. >> REVITALIZATION CANNOT HAPPEN<br>
<br>
WITHOUT BALANCE. >> WE SEE REAL IMPACTS FROM<br>
<br>
THIS COME FROM THIS OVERCONCENTRATION ZONE.<br>
<br>
BUT THIS LEGISLATION WILL SEND A MESSAGE THAT WE ARE PUTTING<br>
<br>
TRUST BACK INTO THE COMMUNITIES OF COLOR IMMIGRANTS, REFUGEES<br>
<br>
THAT HAVE SHOULDER THE BURDEN OF RESPONSIBILITY ON THIS CHALLENGE. FOR TOO LONG.<br>
<br>
AND WHEN WE TALK ABOUT REVITALIZATION OF OUR CITY, WE HAVE TO CONSIDER THE REVITALIZATION OF THESE<br>
<br>
NEIGHBORHOODS BECAUSE YOU CANNOT HAVE A DOWNTOWN<br>
<br>
REVITALIZATION WITHOUT A TENDERLOIN REVITALIZATION EITHER. >> LET'S ALSO BE CLEAR THAT<br>
<br>
THIS IS A BUDGET DECISION AND A BUDGET REFLECTS OUR VALUES.<br>
<br>
>> WE'RE SAYING THAT CITY FUNDS SHOULD FOLLOW UNMET NEED NOT<br>
<br>
POLITICAL CONVENIENCE. >> THIS IS HOW WE REBUILD<br>
<br>
PUBLIC TRUST, DELIVER PUBLIC OUTCOMES BETTER OUTCOMES<br>
<br>
AND TRULY ACT LIKE ONE CITY. >> IN CLOSING, I WANT TO<br>
<br>
ACKNOWLEDGE SO MANY PEOPLE WHO HAVE LED IN ENSURING<br>
<br>
AND COLLABORATING ON THIS LEGISLATION.<br>
<br>
FIRST I WANT TO THANK MY LEGISLATIVE DIRECTOR SAM LOGAN WHO PUT IN HUNDREDS OF HOURS ONTO THIS LEGISLATION AND THOSE<br>
<br>
HUNDREDS OF HOURS HAVE RESULTED IN A COLLABORATIVE APPROACH<br>
<br>
BRINGING TOGETHER SO MANY DIFFERENT COMMUNITY STAKEHOLDERS, DEPARTMENTS OFFICES TO COME UP WITH A FIRST<br>
<br>
OF ITS KIND FRAMEWORK THAT WE WILL HOPEFULLY PASS TODAY. >> MY SINCERE THANKS ALSO TO ANNE PIERSON IN THE CITY<br>
<br>
ATTORNEY'S OFFICE FOR HER CLEAR ,STEADY GUIDANCE AND DEEP<br>
<br>
COMMITMENT TO BOTH THE LEGAL AND COMMUNITY IMPACTS OF THIS<br>
<br>
LEGISLATION. >> I'M GRATEFUL TO NICK MINARD AND CHRISTINA MILLER FROM THE BUDGET AND LEGISLATIVE<br>
<br>
ANALYST'S OFFICE WHOSE RIGOROUS ANALYSIS PROVIDED A STRONG<br>
<br>
FOUNDATION FOR EQUITABLE DECISION MAKING. >> DEEP THANKS TO OUR PARTNERS AT THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC<br>
<br>
HEALTH, DEPARTMENT OF HOMELESSNESS AND SUPPORTIVE<br>
<br>
HOUSING ESPECIALLY DYLAN SNYDER AND LEE COHEN, STAFF PATEL<br>
<br>
AND CLAIRE ALTMAN FOR THEIR GUIDANCE, FEEDBACK AND COMMITMENT TO MAKING THIS FRAMEWORK WORKABLE ON THE<br>
<br>
GROUND. >> I ALSO WANT TO THANK THE MANY NEIGHBORHOOD LEADERS, SERVICE PROVIDERS AND COMMUNITY<br>
<br>
PARTNERS WHO HAVE CARRIED THIS VISION FOR YEARS.<br>
<br>
YOUR PERSISTENCE AND HIS INSIGHT AND BELIEF IN A MORE<br>
<br>
EQUITABLE CITY HAVE SHAPED EVERY PART OF THIS ORDINANCE.<br>
<br>
>> AND FINALLY, I WANT TO THANK YOU TO MY COLLEAGUES SUPERVISORS WALTON, DORSEY, SAUTER AND MELGAR FOR YOUR<br>
<br>
EARLY SUPPORT AND SHARED COMMITMENT TO ENSURING OUR<br>
<br>
SYSTEM OF CARE REFLECTS OUR CITYWIDE VALUES. AND IMPORTANTLY, I WANT TO THANK SUPERVISOR WALTON WHO LED<br>
<br>
US AS A BOARD OF SUPERVISORS TO UNANIMOUSLY VOTE IN FAVOR OF<br>
<br>
GEOGRAPHIC EQUITY EARLIER THIS YEAR.<br>
<br>
THIS LEGISLATION WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN POSSIBLE WITHOUT HIS EARLY<br>
<br>
ADVOCACY AND CHAMPIONSHIP. >> SO TODAY, COLLEAGUES, WE HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO BREAK THAT STATUS QUO TO SAY THAT<br>
<br>
GEOGRAPHIC EQUITY COMMUNITY PARTNERSHIP AND DATA DRIVEN<br>
<br>
PLANNING ARE NOT JUST IDEALS BUT THE NEW STANDARD FOR HOW WE<br>
<br>
CARE FOR OUR MOST VULNERABLE. >> THIS ORDINANCE CHARTS A<br>
<br>
CLEAR PATH FORWARD ONE THAT DELIVERS SHELTER AND STABILITY<br>
<br>
TO THOSE WHO NEED IT MOST. >> BRINGS BALANCE TO NEIGHBORHOODS THAT HAVE LONG BEEN ASKED TO CARRY TOO MUCH<br>
<br>
AND RESTORES TRUST IN OUR CITY'S ABILITY TO LEAD WITH<br>
<br>
BOTH COMPASSION AND FAIRNESS. >> I URGE YOUR SUPPORT NOT JUST<br>
<br>
FOR THE LEGISLATION BUT FOR A MORE UNITED AND MORE JUST SAN<br>
<br>
FRANCISCO. >> THANK YOU. SUPERVISOR JAN. >> THANK YOU PRESIDENT MENDHAM<br>
<br>
AND COLLEAGUES AS I HAVE STATED IN THE COMMITTEE AT THE BUDGET<br>
<br>
AND FINANCE COMMITTEE I AGREE WITH SUPERVISOR BELAL MAHMOOD<br>
<br>
THAT NEIGHBORHOODS SUCH AS TENDERLOIN AND SODA MARKET HOW SHOULDER THE BURDEN OF PROVIDING SHELTER AND SERVICES<br>
<br>
TO UNHOUSED INDIVIDUALS IN OUR CITY.<br>
<br>
THIS HAS RESULTED IN DECADES OF SATURATION OF BLIGHT IN THESE<br>
<br>
NEIGHBORHOODS AND THE DATA CONFIRMS THE SATURATION. THAT'S WHY I HAVE CONTINUED TO SAY I WOULD SUPPORT A<br>
<br>
MORATORIUM ON SHELTERS IN CERTAIN NEIGHBORHOODS.<br>
<br>
THIS IS A MOMENT OF HUMAN TERRIBLE CRISIS.<br>
<br>
OUR CITY NEEDS TO FOCUS ON DELIVERING EQUITABLE SERVICES<br>
<br>
FOR THE PEOPLE WHO ARE IN NEED. HAVE FLEXIBILITY TO MEET THE<br>
<br>
PUBLIC HEALTH TRENDS AND DEMANDS. BE A DRUG INTERVENTION SHELTER ,HOUSING OR OTHER SERVICES.<br>
<br>
BASED ON THE DATA THAT WE NOW HAVE. WE HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO UNDERSTAND THE ACTUAL NEEDS OF<br>
<br>
AND HOUSE PEOPLE. THEY ARE NOT MONOLITH.<br>
<br>
INSTEAD OF SIMPLE PERCENTAGE BY NEIGHBORHOODS WHICH IS WHAT<br>
<br>
WE'RE SEEING RIGHT NOW HAS YET TO REALLY DIG DEEP<br>
<br>
AND UNDERSTAND. LET'S PROVIDE SOLUTIONS ACCORDINGLY. HOWEVER, THE LEGISLATION BEFORE<br>
<br>
US TODAY DESPITE ITS MANY AMENDMENTS IS BOTH OVERTLY<br>
<br>
PRESCRIPTIVE YET NOT PRECISE ENOUGH IN TARGETED SOLUTIONS<br>
<br>
AND ONLY SERVES TO FURTHER DIVIDE OUR NEIGHBORHOODS.<br>
<br>
I WOULD RATHER SUPPORT A SHELTER MORATORIUM AIM FOR<br>
<br>
SATURATED NEIGHBORHOODS AS WE CONTINUE TO SOLVE HOMELESSNESS<br>
<br>
CITYWIDE. FOR THIS REASON I WOULD NOT BE VOTING IN SUPPORT OF THIS LEGISLATION TODAY.<br>
<br>
SUPERVISOR SAUTER THANK YOU PRESIDENT. I WANT TO FIRST APPLAUD MY COLLEAGUES ROSE OR MAHMUD FOR<br>
<br>
ALL OF THE WORK THAT HE POURED INTO THIS. I BELIEVE THIS IS AMBITIOUS LEGISLATION.<br>
<br>
I BELIEVE IT'S IMPORTANT AND MUCH NEEDED LEGISLATION<br>
<br>
AND ALSO TO EXTEND THAT GRATITUDE TOWARDS THE MAYOR'S<br>
<br>
OFFICE FOR THEIR ROLE IN COLLABORATING AND SHAPING<br>
<br>
THIS AND MANY OF MY OTHER COLLEAGUES AS WELL OF COURSE YOU KNOW I WILL BE SUPPORTING THIS YOU KNOW, AS I THINK ABOUT<br>
<br>
THIS LEGISLATION I THINK ABOUT IN MY DISTRICT OUR<br>
<br>
NEIGHBORHOODS OF LOWER HILL WHERE I INHERITED A SITUATION<br>
<br>
WHERE MORE THAN A HALF DOZEN SITES AND SERVICES HAD BEEN<br>
<br>
OPENED IN SHORT ORDER DURING THE PANDEMIC AND THERE HAD BEEN<br>
<br>
NO YOU KNOW, NO PAUSE TO THINK ABOUT THAT OR TO COORDINATE<br>
<br>
THEIR SUCCESS. AND YOU KNOW, LITERALLY JUST THIS MORNING WALKING THROUGH THAT NEIGHBORHOOD HAD A COUPLE<br>
<br>
THAT CAME UP TO ME AND TALKED TO ME ABOUT THIS LEGISLATION<br>
<br>
AND AND SHARED THEIR HOPE AND OPTIMISM, OPTIMISM FOR THIS LEGISLATION BECAUSE IT WILL REQUIRE US TO BE MORE<br>
<br>
THOUGHTFUL ABOUT THIS TO ENSURE THAT WE DO NOT OVER CONCENTRATE<br>
<br>
SERVICES IN ONE NEIGHBORHOOD BY MANY MEASURES DISTRICT THREE<br>
<br>
HAS A SECOND HIGHEST CONCENTRATION OF SERVICES NOW LARGELY BECAUSE OF THE LAST FIVE YEARS IN LOWER HILL.<br>
<br>
SO I BELIEVE THIS IS AGAIN THOUGHTFUL.<br>
<br>
I BELIEVE IT'S NEEDED AND I WILL BE SUPPORTING THIS TODAY.<br>
<br>
>> SUPERVISOR DORSEY THANK YOU PRESIDENT RANDLEMAN I'D LIKE TO<br>
<br>
START BY THANKING SUPERVISOR MAHMOOD FOR INTRODUCING<br>
<br>
AND WORKING TO SHAPE THIS LEGISLATION AND ALSO TO<br>
<br>
SUPERVISOR WALTON FOR HIS LEADERSHIP AS A CO-SPONSOR.<br>
<br>
I'M PROUD TO ALSO JOIN AS A CO-SPONSOR AND I ONLY APOLOGIZE<br>
<br>
THAT A LATE COMMITMENT EARLIER PREVENTED ME FROM BEING ON THE CITY HALL STEPS TO FOR FOR THE EVENT.<br>
<br>
FOR TOO LONG OUR DISTRICTS HAVE SHOULDERED A DISPROPORTIONATE<br>
<br>
SHARE OF HOMELESS SERVICES IN DISTRICT SIX.<br>
<br>
I'VE SEEN FIRSTHAND HOW CONCENTRATING VULNERABLE<br>
<br>
POPULATIONS IN JUST A FEW NEIGHBORHOODS CAN EXACERBATE<br>
<br>
RATHER THAN SOLVE MANY OF THE CHALLENGES THAT WE'RE FACING OVER SATURATION DOESN'T ONLY STRAINED COMMUNITIES I THINK IT<br>
<br>
ALSO ERODES PUBLIC SUPPORT FOR THE VERY SERVICES WE NEED TO<br>
<br>
BEST ADDRESS THE CHALLENGES FACING VULNERABLE SAN<br>
<br>
FRANCISCANS. I THINK THIS ORDINANCE CREATES A FRAMEWORK FOR A SMARTER, FAIRER SITE SITING SCHEME AND I<br>
<br>
THINK DECISIONS THAT ARE GROUNDED IN DATA TRANSPARENCY AND EARLY COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT WILL SUCCEED BEST.<br>
<br>
THESE ARE PRINCIPLES MY CONSTITUENTS HAVE ASKED FOR<br>
<br>
AND THEY'RE EMBEDDED IN THIS LEGISLATION. I WANT TO THANK ESPECIALLY THE MANY DISTRICT SIX RESIDENTS<br>
<br>
AND PARTNERS WHO ARE PART OF THIS INCLUDING SOMA WEST<br>
<br>
NEIGHBORHOOD ASSOCIATION AND THE SOUTHWEST CBD AMONG<br>
<br>
OTHERS WHO HAVE ENGAGED ON THIS ISSUE.<br>
<br>
THEIR VOICES HELPS TO SHAPE THIS ORDINANCE AND THAT IS<br>
<br>
THANKS IN LARGE PART TO THE WILLINGNESS OF ITS AUTHOR TO LISTEN TO THOSE VOICES AND I REALLY APPRECIATE IT.<br>
<br>
SO THANK YOU SUPERVISOR MAHMOOD. I'M PROUD TO SUPPORT THIS AND I THANK YOU FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP<br>
<br>
ON IT. >> SUPERVISOR ONE THANK YOU<br>
<br>
PRESIDENT MADAM AND I JUST WANT TO THANK SUPERVISOR MAHMOOD.<br>
<br>
SUPERVISORS DORSEY SOUDER AND MELGAR FOR THEIR<br>
<br>
CO-SPONSORSHIP IN BRINGING THIS LEGISLATION FORWARD. I ALSO WANT TO SEND A SPECIAL THANK YOU TO SUPERVISOR MAHMUD<br>
<br>
FOR HIS WILLINGNESS TO WORK WITH OTHERS COOPERATIVELY TO<br>
<br>
MOVE TOWARDS A SUCCESSFUL AND EQUITABLE WAY TO COMBAT<br>
<br>
HOMELESSNESS AND PROVIDE SERVICES FOR OUR UNHOUSED<br>
<br>
IN THIS CITY. I DO WANT PEOPLE TO UNDERSTAND THAT THIS LEGISLATION IS NOT AN ANTI SHELTER STRATEGY<br>
<br>
IN CERTAIN COMMUNITIES BUT MORE OF A PRO SE SHELTER<br>
<br>
AND HOMELESS SERVICES STRATEGY ACROSS THE CITY AND IN AREAS<br>
<br>
THAT HAVE OPPORTUNITY TO PROVIDE MORE SUPPORT.<br>
<br>
A LOT OF WORK HAS GONE INTO GETTING HERE AND ALTHOUGH I<br>
<br>
DON'T FEEL THIS LEGISLATION HAS THE COMPLETE NECESSARY TEETH TO<br>
<br>
GUARANTEE THAT WE HAVE EQUITABLE ACCESS THROUGHOUT SAN<br>
<br>
FRANCISCO, IT MOST CERTAINLY IS THE FIRST LEGISLATION OF ITS<br>
<br>
KIND AND RECOGNIZES THAT SHELTER AND SERVICES FOR OUR<br>
<br>
UNHOUSED POPULATION SHOULD BE IN CLOSE PROXIMITY<br>
<br>
AND AVAILABLE FOR ALL. IF WE ARE EVER GOING TO TRULY<br>
<br>
ADDRESS THE ROOT CAUSES AND THE ISSUES SURROUNDING HOMELESSNESS<br>
<br>
IT'S THAT WE MUST ALL WORK IN UNISON. THIS IS SOMETHING THAT AFFECTS THIS ENTIRE CITY AND WE SHOULD<br>
<br>
ADDRESS IT AS SUCH AND ENSURE THAT NO ONE COMMUNITY IS<br>
<br>
OVERWHELMINGLY CHARGED WITH PROVIDING SHELTER AND SERVICES<br>
<br>
FOR OUR UNHOUSED COMMUNITY. WE ALL PLAY A ROLE IN GETTING<br>
<br>
PEOPLE OFF OF OUR STREETS AND INTO SHELTER.<br>
<br>
SO I WANT TO THANK AGAIN EVERYONE WHO WORKED ON THIS AND FOR EVERYONE COMING TOGETHER COLLABORATIVELY<br>
<br>
AND PROUD TO CO-SPONSOR THIS LEGISLATION.<br>
<br>
>> SUPERVISOR JEN THANK YOU PRESIDENT MANDO MAN.<br>
<br>
COLLEAGUES, I THINK WE ALL WANT MEANINGFUL SOLUTION TO<br>
<br>
HOMELESSNESS AND OUR COMMUNITY DESERVE A THOUGHTFUL PLANNING,<br>
<br>
TRANSPARENT COMMUNICATION, EFFECTIVE STRATEGY, SUPPORTIVE<br>
<br>
SERVICES AND HOUSING THAT TRULY HELPS STABILIZE PEOPLE AND PUT<br>
<br>
THEM ON A PATH TO SAFER, HEALTHIER AND SUSTAINABLE<br>
<br>
HOUSING OPPORTUNITIES. >> FOR MY OWN DISTRICT, EQUITY<br>
<br>
MEANS INVESTING IN WRAPAROUND SERVICES AND PERMANENT<br>
<br>
AFFORDABLE HOUSING. >> I WOULD LIKE TO SEE A MORE<br>
<br>
INVESTMENT IN DEEPLY AFFORDABLE HOUSING IN DISTRICT 11 AND I<br>
<br>
WOULD ALSO WELCOME INTERIM USE AT DOE'S AFFORDABLE HOUSING<br>
<br>
SITE THAT ALLOW US TO SERVE UNHOUSED NEIGHBORS<br>
<br>
AND HOPEFULLY TRANSITION THEM INTO A PERMANENT HOUSING SOLUTION IN THE FUTURE. >> THIS ARE THE KIND OF<br>
<br>
INVESTMENT DISTRICT 11 NEEDS AND DESERVES AND WE KNOW IT'S<br>
<br>
POSSIBLE FOR TWO YEARS PRIOR TO THE GROUNDBREAKING OF KAPUSO AT<br>
<br>
THE UPPER YOUNG AFFORDABLE HOUSING DEVELOPMENT. WE HAD A TEMPORARY RV SITE WHERE VIRTUALLY HOUSED IT<br>
<br>
NEIGHBORS COULD SAFELY PARK AND LIVE.<br>
<br>
>> THIS PROCESS INCLUDED AMPLE COMMUNITY INPUT AND EVENTUALLY<br>
<br>
GARNERED SUPPORT FROM THE NEIGHBORHOOD.<br>
<br>
>> FOR TOO LONG MY DISTRICT HAS RECEIVED A TOO FEW RESOURCES TO<br>
<br>
MEET THE BASIC NEEDS FOR ALL OUR RESIDENTS INCLUDING THE<br>
<br>
MOST PRIMARY CITY SERVICES INTENDED TO PROMOTE PUBLIC<br>
<br>
SAFETY, PUBLIC HEALTH, CLEAN STREET AND MORE.<br>
<br>
I DON'T BELIEVE THIS PIECE OF LEGISLATION AS IT HAS BEEN<br>
<br>
AMENDED GETS US TOWARDS THIS GOALS AND TOWARD THE GOALS OF<br>
<br>
GEOGRAPHIC EQUITY PLACING A SHELTER IN EVERY NEIGHBORHOOD<br>
<br>
WITHOUT INTENTIONAL COMMUNITY INPUT WON'T ADDRESS ROOT CAUSES<br>
<br>
OF HOUSING UNAFFORDABILITY, BEHAVIORAL HEALTH ISSUES AND MORE. >> FURTHER, I FEAR THAT IT PITS<br>
<br>
COURT SERVICES AGAINST NEIGHBORHOOD AGAINST CITY<br>
<br>
AGENCIES AS WELL. THUS I WON'T BE SUPPORTIVE OF<br>
<br>
THIS LEGISLATION TODAY. WHY? I STRONGLY BELIEVE THAT IN GEOGRAPHIC EQUITY OF<br>
<br>
SERVICES. >> I ALSO BELIEVE OUR FOCUS<br>
<br>
SHOULD BE ON PROVIDING PERMANENT SOLUTION THAT ADDRESS THE ROOT CAUSES OF HOUSING INSECURITY INCLUDING<br>
<br>
SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENT INTO PREVENTABLE SOLUTION<br>
<br>
AND EXPERTISE DEVELOPING DEEPLY AFFORDABLE HOUSING.<br>
<br>
AND I HOPE THAT I CAN WORK WITH MY COLLEAGUES ON THE BOARD<br>
<br>
AND THE MAYOR'S OFFICE TO MOVE FORWARD WITH THIS KIND OF INVESTMENT IN THE CITY. THANK YOU.<br>
<br>
>> SUPERVISOR MELGAR. THANK YOU PRESIDENT.<br>
<br>
I WILL START BY SAYING THANK YOU SUPERVISOR MAHMUD FOR THE<br>
<br>
AMOUNT OF WORK THAT WENT INTO THIS ORDINANCE AND TO OUR<br>
<br>
COLLEAGUES WHO ARE CO-SPONSORS. I AM THE SUPERVISOR FOR ONE OF<br>
<br>
THE WEST SIDE NEIGHBORHOODS THAT HAS SEEN NO SERVICES<br>
<br>
SHELTERS, TRANSITIONAL HOUSING OR BEHAVIORAL RESIDENTIAL<br>
<br>
SERVICES. REALLY, HOWEVER, WITH THE<br>
<br>
EXCEPTION OF LAGUNA HONDA WHERE WE HAVE SEEN SOME OF THE<br>
<br>
ACTIVITIES AT BE AT RISK. AND SO I WILL SAY THAT AT<br>
<br>
WHEREAS I AGREE THAT COMMUNITY INPUT IS REALLY IMPORTANT.<br>
<br>
IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT SOME COMMUNITY<br>
<br>
EES DO NOT WANT TO HAVE SERVICES ANYWHERE NEAR THE<br>
<br>
COMMUNITY. AND THAT'S A PROBLEM BECAUSE<br>
<br>
FOLKS ARE HOMELESS IN EVERY SINGLE DISTRICT IN SAN<br>
<br>
FRANCISCO ABOUT THREE YEARS AGO.<br>
<br>
ANOTHER COLLEAGUE WHO IS NOW IN THE ASSEMBLY INTRODUCED<br>
<br>
LEGISLATION THAT WOULD HAVE DONE SOMETHING SIMILAR.<br>
<br>
>> HOWEVER, HE CHOSE TO HAVE A VERY SPECIFIC TOOL<br>
<br>
AND NAVIGATION CENTER SITED IN EVERY DISTRICT.<br>
<br>
I THINK THIS LEGISLATION IS MUCH MORE FLEXIBLE THAN THAT.<br>
<br>
IT ACKNOWLEDGES THAT EVERY POPULATION AND EVERY GEOGRAPHY<br>
<br>
HAS SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT NEEDS AND ONE TOOL IS NOT NECESSARILY<br>
<br>
THE APPROPRIATE ONE EVERYWHERE .<br>
<br>
SO I HAVE SEEN IN MY DISTRICT A GREAT INCREASE OF FOLKS<br>
<br>
EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS. A LOT OF IT IS DUE TO THE<br>
<br>
ACTIVITIES DOWNTOWN IN THE TENDERLOIN IN SOMA WHERE A<br>
<br>
POLICE PRESENCE HAS SHIFTED PEOPLE TO GO TO OTHER PLACES.<br>
<br>
AND WHAT HAS HAPPENED IS THAT THOSE PLACES WHERE FOLKS FEEL<br>
<br>
LIKE, YOU KNOW, THEY'RE LEFT ALONE HAVE NO SERVICES, THERE'S<br>
<br>
NO OPPORTUNITY TO SUPPORT MENTAL HEALTH, TO SUPPORT<br>
<br>
BEHAVIORAL HEALTH, TO SUPPORT DRUG ADDICTION, ALL OF THOSE<br>
<br>
THINGS THAT WE KNOW ARE NECESSARY TO GET PEOPLE TO<br>
<br>
SUCCESS. SO I I'M GLAD WE'RE EVEN HAVING<br>
<br>
THIS CONVERSATION BECAUSE PRIOR TO THIS IT WASN'T EVEN AN<br>
<br>
ACKNOWLEDGMENT THAT, YOU KNOW, THERE IS A LACK OF EQUITY BOTH<br>
<br>
IN COMMUNITIES THAT HAVE TAKEN MORE THAN THEIR FAIR SHARE BUT<br>
<br>
AN ACKNOWLEDGMENT THAT SOME COMMUNITIES HAVE NO SUPPORT<br>
<br>
AND HAVE A REALLY BIG PROBLEM LIKE MINE.<br>
<br>
AND I AM LOOKING FORWARD TO THE DAY WHERE WE HAVE HOT TEAMS.<br>
<br>
WE HAVE, YOU KNOW, SHELTER BEDS .<br>
<br>
WE HAVE PLACES WHERE PEOPLE CAN GO AND GET BETTER, BE OFF THE<br>
<br>
STREETS AND HAVE A PATH TOWARD SUCCESS. SO I VERY MUCH WELCOME THIS. I'M PROUD TO BE A CO-SPONSOR<br>
<br>
AND THANK YOU SUPERVISOR OBAMA. >> THANK YOU.<br>
<br>
SUPERVISOR MELGAR. >> FOR MYSELF I WANT TO THANK<br>
<br>
SUPERVISOR MAHMOOD FOR YOUR WORK ON THIS LEGISLATION.<br>
<br>
>> I WAS PROBABLY ONE OF THE HARDER VOTES TO GET AND I<br>
<br>
APPRECIATE YOUR WILLINGNESS TO ENGAGE WITH ME.<br>
<br>
I OWN MY TIME ON THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS. I HAVE BECOME CONCERNED THAT OF COURSE AS I WOULD AGREE WITH<br>
<br>
SUPERVISOR MELGAR AND A NUMBER OF YOU THAT THAT WE NEED PLACES<br>
<br>
WE NEED PLACES FOR PEOPLE TO COME IN TO OFF THE STREETS<br>
<br>
AND THAT WAS THE MOTIVATOR FOR MY PUSH FOR PLACE FOR ALL<br>
<br>
AND SHELTER FOR ALL. I'VE ALSO SEEN THE IMPACTS THAT<br>
<br>
PLACES BADLY DONE OR OVERLY CONCENTRATED CAN HAVE ON<br>
<br>
PARTICULAR NEIGHBORHOODS AND I THINK IT IS NOT UNREASONABLE<br>
<br>
FOR NEIGHBORHOODS IN SAN FRANCISCO TO SEE WHAT HAS<br>
<br>
HAPPENED IN SOME NEIGHBORHOODS AND SAY UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES<br>
<br>
HERE. AND SO I THINK THE THE<br>
<br>
PROPOSALS THE LEGISLATION HAS I THINK GENERATED CONCERN FROM<br>
<br>
FOLKS WHO ARE AFRAID OF THAT. I APPRECIATE YOUR WILLINGNESS AGAIN TO ENGAGE THE MAYOR'S OFFICE, TO ENGAGE WITH<br>
<br>
COLLEAGUES, TO ENGAGE WITH ME AND I THINK THAT THIS IS A<br>
<br>
GEOGRAPHIC EQUITY RESOLUTION THAT I THAT I CAN SUPPORT.<br>
<br>
I'M HAPPY TO VOTE FOR IT. I THINK THE CONVERSATION<br>
<br>
CONTINUES BECAUSE I'M NOT SURE I MEAN WHAT I AM SURE OF IS<br>
<br>
THAT WE DON'T WANT TO SEE SHELTERS DOTTING THE LAND<br>
<br>
AND CREATING THE IMPACTS IN ALL OF THE NEIGHBORHOODS OF SAN<br>
<br>
FRANCISCO IN THE WAY THAT THEY HAVE IMPACTED A FEW. THAT'S NOT WHAT THIS LEGISLATION DOES.<br>
<br>
I SUPPORT THIS LEGISLATION AND I WANT TO THANK SUPERVISOR<br>
<br>
MAHMOOD FOR FOR THE EXTENSIVE WORK AND OUTREACH<br>
<br>
AND WILLINGNESS TO BE FLEXIBLE. I'M A MUCH MORE STUBBORN<br>
<br>
PERSON. I APPRECIATE I APPRECIATE YOUR FLEXIBILITY. WITH THAT, MADAM CLERK, COULD<br>
<br>

<br>
GO TO OUR 230 SPECIAL ORDER YES THE 230 SPECIAL ORDER IS THE<br>
<br>
RECOGNITION OF COMMENDATIONS FOR MERITORIOUS SERVICE TO THE<br>
<br>
CITY AND COUNTY OF SAN FRANCISCO.<br>
<br>
GOT A LOT OF FOLKS HERE TODAY AND I THINK WE GOT AT LEAST ONE<br>
<br>
OF THEM WITH A FLIGHT TO CATCH. AND SO SUPERVISORS SORTER<br>
<br>
DISTRICT THREE, WE'RE GOING TO TAKE YOU OUT OF ORDER. >> THANK YOU, PRESIDENT AND COLLEAGUES TODAY I HAVE THE<br>
<br>
HONOR OF RECOGNIZING THE CONSUL GENERAL OF ITALY, SERGIO<br>
<br>
STROZZI. >> SERGIO, WOULD YOU PLEASE<br>
<br>
JOIN US? >> SERGIO HAS SERVED IN THIS<br>
<br>
ROLE SINCE 2021 AND WE ARE HONORING HIM TODAY JUST THAT<br>
<br>
OURS IS A DAYS JUST HOURS BEFORE HIS FLIGHT TO ROME FOR A<br>
<br>
NEW POST, SERGIO CAME INTO THIS ROLE AS OUR CITY WAS REELING<br>
<br>
FROM THE PANDEMIC AND YET DESPITE THAT HE GOT TO WORK<br>
<br>
RIGHT AWAY DOING THE EVERYDAY ROUTINE WORK OF VISAS<br>
<br>
AND PASSPORTS BUT ALSO PURSUING AMBITIOUS NEW PROGRAMS TO BRING<br>
<br>
OUR COMMUNITIES AND COUNTRIES TOGETHER THROUGH SHARED<br>
<br>
INVESTMENTS IN TRADE, TECHNOLOGY AND CULTURE.<br>
<br>
IN ONE EXAMPLE HIS LEADERSHIP TO ESTABLISH THE INNOVATE<br>
<br>
PROGRAM MEANS THAT HUNDREDS OF ITALIAN ENTREPRENEURS AND CREATIVES ARE NOW EMBEDDED WITH THE BRIGHTEST MINDS<br>
<br>
IN SILICON VALLEY AND WORKING WITH COMPANIES LIKE SALESFORCE,<br>
<br>
APPLE AND GOOGLE. >> SERGIO ALSO TOOK EVERY<br>
<br>
OPPORTUNITY POSSIBLE TO BE A CHAMPION FOR THE RICH ITALIAN<br>
<br>
AMERICAN HERITAGE OF SAN FRANCISCO ESPECIALLY<br>
<br>
IN DISTRICT THREE NORTH BEACH. JUST LAST WEEK WE STOOD ALONGSIDE EACH OTHER IN UNVEILING A NEW PLAQUE FOR<br>
<br>
AP GIANNINI AT WASHINGTON SQUARE PARK, WHICH IS PART OF<br>
<br>
THE BROADER LITTLE ITALY HONOR WALK.<br>
<br>
WE WERE LUCKY TO HAVE CONSUL STROZZI BASED IN SAN FRANCISCO<br>
<br>
BUT HIS WORK STRETCHED FURTHER. HE COVERED WESTERN STATES INCLUDING WASHINGTON, OREGON, UTAH, IDAHO, MONTANA, HAWAII<br>
<br>
AND ALASKA. AND IT WAS NOT JUST SERGIO THAT<br>
<br>
OUR ITALIAN COMMUNITIES EMBRACED BUT ALSO HIS DELIGHTFUL FAMILY HIS PARTNER SIMONE AND HIS DAUGHTER<br>
<br>
KATERINA. THEY DID ALL OF THIS TOGETHER<br>
<br>
AS A TEAM. I KNOW THAT HE HAS MADE A<br>
<br>
PROFOUND IMPACT ON EVERYONE HE INTERACTED WITH MAY HAVE BEEN<br>
<br>
IN SHARP DRESS HIS FINE BEARD BUT MOST OF ALL I THINK IT WAS<br>
<br>
HIS WARMTH THAT TOUCHED PEOPLE IN A SHARED UNDERSTANDING A<br>
<br>
SHARED HUMANITY FROM COUNTRY TO COUNTRY AND OPTIMISM THAT OUR<br>
<br>
BEST DAYS ARE AHEAD OF US BUT CAN BE REACHED ONLY THROUGH<br>
<br>
MUTUAL PARTNERSHIP. SERGIO PLEASE DON'T BE A<br>
<br>
STRANGER TO SAN FRANCISCO. YOU WILL ALWAYS HAVE A HOME<br>
<br>
AND A PLACE HERE AND NOW IF YOU WISH THE FLOOR IS YOURS TO SAY<br>

<br>
OH CHEN SORRY NOT CHEN SUPERVISOR CHEN THANK YOU,<br>

<br>
SAN FRANCISCO AND IT'S BEEN WONDERFUL TO HAVE YOU HERE<br>
<br>
AND I'M GOING TO MISS YOU. >> THANK YOU.<br>
<br>
THANK YOU, PRESIDENT BOTH IT'S A PROVIDES I FEEL PRIVILEGED,<br>
<br>
HUMBLE AND MORE THAN HONORED TO BE HERE WITH YOU TODAY.<br>
<br>
IT'S ACTUALLY YOU'RE RIGHT, SUPERVISOR SUTTER, IT'S I'M GOING TO FLY ON THURSDAY. I CAN'T BELIEVE IT.<br>
<br>
I'M TELLING YOU BECAUSE I'VE BEEN ROOTING SO MUCH IN SAN<br>
<br>
FRANCISCO. I'M TALKING TO PEOPLE THAT<br>
<br>
DON'T KNOW ME BUT I RIDE IN 2022 WITH MY FAMILY IN 2021.<br>
<br>
WE'RE VERY FAMILY AND WE BUILD UP A LOT OF THINGS THAT<br>
<br>
SUPERVISORS SO THAT YOU SUMMED IT UP SO WELL I'M NOT GOING TO BOTHER YOU WITH DETAILS BUT YEAH, THE MAIN GOAL WAS TO<br>
<br>
BRIDGE MORE SAN FRANCISCO AND ITALY WHICH IS A LITERARY<br>
<br>
NIGHTMARE BECAUSE SAN FRANCISCO AND ITALY IS SOMETHING WHICH IS<br>
<br>
NATURAL TO BE A BRIDGE BETWEEN THE TWO PLACES.<br>
<br>
>> LET ME REMIND THE WORDS OF MARIO DANIEL DURING THE ITALIAN<br>
<br>
NATIONAL DAY RECEPTION IT SAYS SAN FRANCISCO SIMPLY WOULD SAN<br>
<br>
FRANCISCO WITHOUT THE ITALIAN-AMERICAN COMMUNITY.<br>
<br>
OUR IMMIGRANTS CAME HERE LATE 19TH CENTURY POOR FAMILIES,<br>
<br>
POOR WORKERS, HARD WORKERS AND THEY BUILT UP THEIR WAY<br>
<br>
AND THEIR LIFE WITH THEIR FAMILIES THROUGH THE DECADES.<br>
<br>
AND I FEEL HONORED TO HAVE REPRESENTED THIS COMMUNITY BUT<br>
<br>
ALSO TO HAVE BROUGHT TO SAN FRANCISCO SOME ITALIAN<br>
<br>
INNOVATION AND TECH COMMUNITY WHAT THE INNOVATE THE ITALIAN<br>
<br>
INNOVATION HUB IN JACKSON SQUARE IS NOT A SHORT TERM<br>
<br>
PROJECT. IT'S A LONG TERM PROJECT TO<br>
<br>
BRIDGE COMPANIES IN SAN FRANCISCO AND ITALY, ITALIAN<br>
<br>
COMPANIES IN THE FIELD OF INNOVATION AND TECHNOLOGY. SO WHAT WE'VE DONE HERE IN THE PAST YEARS WAS EXACTLY TO<br>
<br>
BRIDGE IN THE LONG TERM THE COMMUNITIES THE ITALIAN BUT<br>
<br>
ALSO THE OTHER COMMUNITIES OF SAN FRANCISCO SO VIBRANT ONES,<br>
<br>
SO LIVELY ONES AND ITALY THE ITALIANS THAT LIVE IN THE<br>
<br>
COUNTRY LET ME REMIND THE SAN FRANCISCO, ITALY THE WALK HAS<br>
<br>
BEEN A MILESTONE IN OUR DURING OUR TENURE HONORING THE<br>
<br>
GREATEST ITALIAN FIGURES AND THE ITALIAN AMERICAN THAT<br>
<br>
CONTRIBUTED TO MAKE SAN FRANCISCO THE GREAT CITIES<br>
<br>
INNOVATE ON THE TAX SIDE AND ALSO LET ME THANK YOU<br>
<br>
SUPERVISOR FOR THE GREAT COLLABORATION WE HAD.<br>
<br>
I HAVE TO THANK YOU IN PERSON BECAUSE I WAS NOT HERE THAT<br>
<br>
TIME WHEN YOU TOOK THE DECISION ABOUT THE SAN FRANCISCO<br>

<br>
BEEN WORKING AND COLLABORATING WITH PRESIDENT MANDAN MANNER<br>
<br>
WITH YOU SUPERVISOR SOTO WITH SUPERVISOR CHANG.<br>
<br>
IT'S BEEN REALLY UNBELIEVABLE JOURNEY FOR ME TO BE HERE WITH<br>
<br>
THE MISSION SAN FRANCISCO BUT THE GOOD NEWS IS THAT I'LL BE<br>
<br>
BACK TO THE MINISTER OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS BEING A DIPLOMAT<br>
<br>
AND NOT A POLITICAL ONE SO I'M GOING CROSS POLITICAL COLORS<br>
<br>
LET'S SAY, WHICH MAKES THINGS A LITTLE BIT EASIER FOR ME TO HANDLE AND I'LL BE HEADING AS WELL TODAY I HAD THE OFFICE FOR<br>
<br>
INNOVATION TECHNOLOGY STARTUP SO NOTHING CLOSER TO SAN<br>
<br>
FRANCISCO AND TO THE VIBRANT PLACE THAT SAN FRANCISCO IS. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR HAVING ME HERE IN THIS FOR YEARS AND FOR<br>
<br>
MAKING MY LIFE SO HAPPY AND MY FAMILY'S LIFE SO HAPPY.<br>

<br>
ABOUT DISTRICT FOR SUPERVISOR ORANGE ENGARDIO GOOD AFTERNOON<br>
<br>
COLLEAGUES I WANT TO RECOGNIZE 30 OF THE MOST IMPORTANT PEOPLE<br>
<br>
AT CITY HALL OUR CUSTODIANS WE COULD NOT DO OUR WORK WITHOUT<br>
<br>
THEM. THE PUBLIC WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO<br>
<br>
USE THIS SPACE WITHOUT THEM FROM PASSIONATE PUBLIC COMMENT<br>
<br>
IN THE BOARD CHAMBERS TO PASSIONATE WEDDINGS UNDER THE DOME OUR CUSTODIANS MAKE SURE IT ALL HAPPENS IN A CLEAN<br>
<br>
AND WELCOMING SPACE FOR EVERYONE AND THE HARDEST WORK<br>
<br>
OF ALL IS KEEPING OUR OFFICES CLEAN EACH PACKED WITH FOUR<br>
<br>
STAFFERS, COUNTLESS INTERNS AND A SUPERVISOR WHERE LONG<br>
<br>
DAYS MEANS LOTS OF SNACKS AND TAKEOUT CONTAINERS TO CLEAN<br>
<br>
UP THE WORK OF A SUPERVISOR AND THEIR STAFF MIGHT MAKE HEADLINES BUT WE MUST ACKNOWLEDGE THE ROLE OUR<br>
<br>

<br>
IMPACTFUL YEARS AS AN ANCHOR AND REPORTER WITH ABC7 HERE<br>

THAT YOU ARE THE ONLY PERSON WHO WOULD BE ABLE TO GET MY FIANCEE TO COME BACK TO THE CHAMBERS AFTER MY INAUGURATION<br>
<br>
DESPITE MANY ATTEMPTS. WHEN I ASKED WHY ARE YOU COMING FOR DIANE? >> BECAUSE SHE SPEAKS FOR US<br>
<br>
ALL. AND I THINK I'VE HEARD FROM HER<br>
<br>
MANY TIMES HOW THERE'S NO POLITICIAN THAT COULD GET HER<br>
<br>
BACK. BUT YOU COULD.<br>
<br>
AND I THINK IT'S BECAUSE OF WHAT YOU REPRESENT AND THE STORIES YOU TELL. YOU'VE TOLD ME HOW YOU REALLY<br>
<br>
WANT TO FOCUS ON ELEVATING OUR COMMUNITY AND SHARING OUR<br>
<br>
STORIES AND OFTEN HAVING TO FIGHT THE POWERS THAT BE TO<br>

HAVE ALSO SAID WHILE OTHERS CHOOSE TO SCAPEGOAT OR LOOK<br>
<br>

<br>
AUTHENTICITY, EMPATHY AND INTEGRITY TO EVERY STORY<br>
<br>
SHE TELLS HER LEADERSHIP IN COVERING ISSUES OF RACE<br>
<br>
AND VIOLENCE HAS RESONATED FAR BEYOND OUR CITY, EARNING HER<br>
<br>
RECOGNITION ALONGSIDE NATIONAL FIGURES AND INVITATIONS TO THE<br>
<br>

<br>
DEEPLY ROOTED HERE IN SAN FRANCISCO WHERE SHE LIVES WITH HER HUSBAND AND SPIRITED TODDLER.<br>

<br>
EVERYBODY. WE'RE BOTH EMERSON LYONS AND IT'S A BIG DEAL FOR FOR THE SCHOOL THAT WE WENT TO.<br>
<br>
I STARTED IN THE POLICE DEPARTMENT AS THE<br>
<br>
COMMUNICATIONS DIRECTOR JUST A FEW WEEKS BEFORE THE COVID<br>
<br>
LOCKDOWN. AND I SAW FIRSTHAND HOW THE<br>
<br>
SCAPEGOATING PLAYED OUT AGAINST OUR AAPI COMMUNITY AND HOW THAT<br>
<br>
PLAYED OUT IN VIOLENT ATTACKS. AND I AM JUST SO GRATEFUL THAT<br>
<br>
IN THAT REALLY DIFFICULT TIME WE HAD A JOURNALIST OF YOUR<br>
<br>
CALIBER TO COVER IT. IT MEANT A LOT TO ME AS<br>
<br>
SOMEBODY WHO CARES ABOUT PUBLIC SAFETY BUT I KNOW IT MEANT A LOT TO EVERYBODY IN THE AAPI COMMUNITY AND EVERYBODY WHO IS<br>
<br>
LIKE AS I AM A GAY MAN IN A VULNERABLE COMMUNITY THAT'S<br>
<br>
ALSO DISPROPORTIONATELY AFFECTED BY HATE CRIME.<br>
<br>
SO I JUST WANT TO THANK SUPERVISOR MAHMOOD FOR HONORING<br>
<br>
YOU AND JUST PILE ON WITH KIND WORDS OF MY OWN. >> CONGRATULATIONS. >> SUPERVISOR AND ENGARDIO AS<br>

<br>
MEETING TO END SO I CAN CHASE ALL OF YOU DOWN WITH A BIG<br>
<br>
MICROPHONE AND GET YOU ALL ON CAMERA. >> BUT I JUST WANT TO SAY AS I LOOK OUT ON THE CROWD AND I<br>
<br>
LOOK OUT AT ALL OF THE SUPERVISORS AND PEOPLE IN SAN<br>
<br>

<br>
SPONSORING THIS. >> AND ALSO FOR EACH AND EVERY<br>

<br>
MANY DIFFERENT FACETS OF MY LIFE.<br>
<br>

<br>
UNSURE OF WHO'S ON THE OTHER SIDE. >> YOU DON'T KNOW WHO IS SUPPORTING YOU BUT YOU SURE AS<br>

<br>
PERSON, THAT THERE IS A COMMUNITY RALLYING BEHIND HIM.<br>
<br>
>> YOU KNOW, DURING THE PANDEMIC AND THROUGHOUT MY<br>
<br>
CAREER I ALWAYS KNEW WHAT REPRESENTATION WAS. >> AT LEAST I THOUGHT I DID. BY HAVING A SEAT AT THE TABLE.<br>
<br>
BUT TRULY WHAT THAT MEANS IS DOING SOMETHING WITH THAT SEAT<br>
<br>
FLIPPING THAT SEAT OVER UNTIL PEOPLE LISTEN.<br>
<br>
MAYBE THAT'S UNCONVENTIONAL FOR A JOURNALIST. WELL, THAT'S NOT MY PROBLEM ANYMORE I SUPPOSE.<br>
<br>
>> BUT WE'VE ACCOMPLISHED SO MUCH AND WE OFTENTIMES TALK<br>
<br>
ABOUT THE HATE, THE VIOLENCE, THE DISCRIMINATION, ALL OF<br>

<br>
LEADERSHIP ROLES INCLUDING EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF COMMUNITY SCHOOL. SHE BASICALLY RESCUED THAT<br>
<br>
DEPARTMENT. I'M LIKE I'M NOT UNDER<br>
<br>
ESTIMATING THAT. >> AND LATER SHE BECAME THE CHIEF OF STUDENT OF FAMILY SERVICES.<br>
<br>
I MET MILLIE IN 2014 MORE THAN ANYONE THAT I'VE EVER MET IN MY<br>
<br>
LIFE. SHE EMBODIES THE CONCEPT OF A<br>
<br>
WARM DEMANDER. THIS IS SOMEONE WHO<br>

>> PRESIDENT VANDEMAN MADAM CLERK SUPERVISORS ENRICO PENICK<br>
<br>
DIRECTOR OF REAL ESTATE. WELL AT LEAST FOR ANOTHER TWO<br>
<br>
DAYS I AM A BIT OVERWHELMED MAN AND THANK YOU FOR THIS HONOR.<br>
<br>
IT WAS UNEXPECTED. I CONSIDER MYSELF JUST TO BE A<br>
<br>
RUN OF THE MILL PUBLIC SERVANT AND I COME TO WORK, I DO MY JOB<br>
<br>
AND I DON'T REALLY EXPECT ALL OF THIS BUT IT IS MUCH<br>
<br>
APPRECIATE IT. I HAVE TO SAY THAT IT'S BEEN IT<br>
<br>
IS WITH EXCITEMENT AND SADNESS THAT I TAKE THIS NEXT STEP<br>
<br>
AND RETIRE FROM CITY EMPLOYMENT .<br>
<br>
THE DIRECTOR OF REAL ESTATE POSITION HAS BEEN ONE OF THE HARDEST JOBS I'VE EVER HAD BUT IT'S ALSO BEEN EXTREMELY<br>
<br>
REWARDING. THE CITY'S REAL ESTATE NEEDS<br>
<br>
IN ITS PORTFOLIO ARE CONSTANTLY CHANGING.<br>
<br>
I AM PROUD TO HAVE PLAYED A SMALL PART IN MEETING THE<br>
<br>
CITY'S REAL ESTATE NEEDS. I AM THANKFUL FOR THE EXPERIENCE AND APPRECIATE WORKING WITH EACH AND EVERY ONE<br>
<br>
OF YOU. MANY OF MY STAFF ARE WATCHING<br>
<br>
ON S.F. GOV TV RIGHT NOW. THEY DIDN'T HAVE THE LUXURY OF<br>
<br>
BEING ABLE TO COME TO THE CHAMBERS.<br>
<br>
AND I WANTED TO GIVE THEM A SHOUT OUT BECAUSE WITHOUT THE<br>
<br>
EXCELLENT STAFF OF THE REAL ESTATE DIVISION AND THAT OF MY SUCCESS IN THIS ROLE WOULD HAVE BEEN POSSIBLE.<br>
<br>
>> I ALSO WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE AND THANK MY WIFE CATHERINE WHO<br>
<br>
IS IN THE AUDIENCE FOR HER LOVE, SUPPORT AND PATIENCE.<br>
<br>
>> THIS ISN'T THE END OF MY JOURNEY.<br>

<br>
WELL-DESERVED BREAK. >> THANK YOU ALL.<br>

<br>
STREET AFTER THE HEARING THE BOARD WILL VOTE ON WHETHER TO<br>

<br>
>> THERE WE GO. THERE WE GO.<br>
<br>
GOOD AFTERNOON, PRESIDENT RANDLEMAN FOR THE SUPERVISORS.<br>
<br>
BEFORE WE GET STARTED, I JUST WONDERED IF YOU RECEIVED THE<br>
<br>
EMAIL ABOUT STRIKING THE FIRST TWO.<br>
<br>
>> YES, WE DID. IF YOU COULD JUST ANNOUNCE THAT<br>
<br>
ON THE RECORD AND SPEAK INTO THAT MICROPHONE AS BEST YOU CAN. THANK YOU SO MUCH.<br>
<br>
>> SO WITH REGARD TO THIS APPEAL, WE'VE DECIDED TO STRIKE<br>
<br>
THE FIRST TWO PORTIONS OF THE APPEAL AND WE'RE GOING TO<br>
<br>
CONTINUE WITH THE THIRD PORTION WHICH PERTAINS PRIMARILY TO<br>
<br>
SAFETY AND SAFETY OF THE NEIGHBORHOOD.<br>
<br>
>> OKAY. SO HELLO.<br>
<br>
MY NAME IS ALI. I LIVE ON CAPP STREET ACROSS FROM MARSHALL ELEMENTARY. >> I'M A NURSE AT S.F. GENERAL<br>
<br>
AND I WORK DAILY WITH NURSES, EMT, SOCIAL WORKERS AND POLICE.<br>
<br>
DEEPLY AWARE OF THE AFFORDABILITY CRISIS IN S.F.<br>
<br>
I'M ALSO ACUTELY AWARE OF THE HEALTH ISSUES THAT CONCERN<br>
<br>
COMMUNITY MEMBERS ACCESSING SAFETY NET HEALTH CARE.<br>
<br>
>> I ALSO REPRESENT A GROUP OF NEIGHBORS AND MARSHALL FAMILIES<br>
<br>
THE DEFENDERS OF MARSHALL LIVING IN THE IMMEDIATE<br>
<br>
VICINITY OF THE PROPOSED 1979 MISSION PROJECT WHO SHARE<br>
<br>
CONCERNS ABOUT THE PROPOSED LOT SUBDIVISION AND THE<br>
<br>
IMPLICATIONS FOR THE PUBLIC HEALTH AND SAFETY OF THE NEIGHBORHOOD ESPECIALLY THE KIDS WHO ATTEND MARSHALL<br>
<br>
ELEMENTARY. >> WE APPEAL THIS SUBDIVISION<br>
<br>
AND MAP AS THE INTENT OF SUBDIVIDING IN 1979 MISSION<br>
<br>
ADVANCES THE PLACEMENT OF AN OVERBUILT PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE<br>
<br>
HOUSING PCH BUILDING WITH ASSOCIATED SUBSTANCE AND PSYCH<br>
<br>
TREATMENT SERVICES WHICH WILL EXACERBATE THE ALREADY DANGEROUS CONDITIONS FOUND AROUND MARSHALL ELEMENTARY<br>
<br>
WHICH SERVES AT RISK STUDENTS INCLUDING IMMIGRANT, HOMELESS,<br>
<br>
LOW INCOME AND STUDENTS OF COLOR.<br>
<br>
>> STATED SIMPLY IF THIS APPEAL IS DENIED THEN PROJECT SPONSORS<br>
<br>
CAN SUBDIVIDE FINANCE AND BUILD PCH AND ASSOCIATED SERVICES<br>
<br>
WHICH WILL ENDANGER THE MARSHALL COMMUNITY.<br>
<br>
IF THE APPEAL IS UPHELD THAT DANGER WILL BE PREVENTED.<br>
<br>
>> AS MARSHALL ELEMENTARY COMMUNITY MEMBERS WE SEEK TO AMPLIFY THE VOICES OF MARSHALL FAMILIES WHO ARE UNABLE TO<br>
<br>
ATTEND THIS HEARING BECAUSE OF THE SUMMER VACATION.<br>
<br>
>> WE NEED THE SUPERVISORS TO GO ON RECORD ON WHETHER THEY<br>
<br>
SUPPORT A DRUG ALCOHOL AND PSYCH TREATMENT CENTER ON<br>
<br>
TOP OF A PRIMARY SCHOOL FULL OF AT RISK STUDENTS.<br>
<br>
>> THE DEFENDERS STRONGLY SUPPORT THE CORE PREMISE OF THE<br>
<br>
PLAZA 16 COALITION TO EXPAND AFFORDABLE HOUSING FOCUSED ON<br>
<br>
WORKING CLASS AND LOW INCOME FAMILIES. DEFENDERS DEMAND THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS IN MISSION HOUSING<br>
<br>
GRANT THE APPEAL UNLESS IT CAN SHOW A SUBSTANTIVE<br>
<br>
AND TRANSPARENT MANNER HOW THE PROJECT PROMOTES HEALTH<br>
<br>
AND SAFETY IN THE CONTEXT OF OUR NEIGHBORHOOD NOT AS A<br>
<br>
STANDALONE DISCRETE CONCEPT BUT IN THE ACTUAL CURRENT CONTEXT<br>
<br>
IN OUR APPEAL. >> DEFENDERS OF MARSHALL WILL SHOW THAT THE CITY AND ASSOCIATED NONPROFITS HAVE<br>
<br>
A POOR TRACK RECORD OF FOLLOWING THROUGH ON PROMISES<br>
<br>
TO MITIGATE DANGEROUS IMPACTS FROM THEIR PROJECTS WITH FEW<br>
<br>
AVENUES FOR REDRESS WHEN CITY FUNDED NONPROFITS FAIL TO MEET<br>
<br>
THEIR OBLIGATIONS. THE SIGHTING OF PCH NEXT TO A<br>
<br>
SCHOOL WITH VULNERABLE STUDENTS IS DANGEROUS AS A STUDY SHOWS IT DRAWS AS MUCH VIOLENT CRIME AS LIQUOR STORES THAT PCH IS<br>
<br>
DANGEROUS AT THIS SITE AS IT ENTERS EXPRESSION OF SYSTEMIC<br>
<br>
AND STRUCTURAL RACISM THAT WOULD BE UNACCEPTABLE AT ANY OTHER ELEMENTARY SCHOOL IN S.F..<br>
<br>
>> THE MARSHALL COMMUNITY HAS BORNE MANY TIMES OVER THE<br>
<br>
BURDEN OF DIFFICULT SOCIAL SERVICES THAT ANY OTHER<br>
<br>
NEIGHBORHOOD SAVE THE TENDERLOIN ALSO THAT WE IN OUR<br>
<br>
NEIGHBORHOOD HAVE WELCOMED FOR 100% AFFORDABLE BUILDINGS<br>
<br>
AND WE SUPPORT MORE MARSHALL PARENTS KNOW RESIDENTS MAKE<br>
<br>
GREAT NEIGHBORS. >> ANYONE INCLUDING THE PROJECT<br>
<br>
SPONSORS WHO TRY TO WEAPONIZE THE TERM NIMBY IN REFERENCE TO<br>
<br>
OUR LEGITIMATE LOCAL CONCERNS OF OUR NEIGHBORHOOD IS<br>
<br>
DISINGENUOUS AND IN DENIAL. >> AFFORDABLE HEALTH HOUSING IS<br>
<br>
NOT A BINARY OF BEING FOR OR AGAINST CITING PCH HERE IS A<br>
<br>
QUESTION OF SAFETY, NUANCE AND PROPORTION WITHIN THE<br>
<br>
CURRENT CONTEXT OF THIS NEIGHBORHOOD.<br>
<br>
THE SUBDIVISION WILL HAVE SIGNIFICANT CONSEQUENCES FOR<br>
<br>
THIS NEIGHBORHOOD. ITS LONG TERM HEALTH, SUSTAINABILITY AND PROSPERITY AS WELL AS OTHER COMMUNITIES<br>
<br>
FACING THE SAME TYPES OF PROJECTS IN THE FUTURE.<br>
<br>
>> THE NIMBYS HERE ARE THE PROJECT SPONSORS WHO LIVE ELSEWHERE FORCING UNDESIRABLE LAND USES IN THE BACKYARD OF<br>
<br>
BROWN KIDS SCHOOLS NOT THEIRS. >> WITH RESPECT TO THIS PROJECT<br>
<br>
YIMBY NOW MEANS YES IN MARSHALL'S BACKYARD.<br>
<br>
>> SO WITH REGARD TO HISTORY OF OUR NEIGHBORHOOD MARSHALL<br>
<br>
NEIGHBORHOOD HAS BEEN DESIGNATED AS AT RISK AND IS<br>
<br>
OVERBURDENED WITH MANY SOCIAL SERVICE FACILITIES SOME OF<br>
<br>
WHICH NEGATIVELY IMPACT THE COMMUNITY AND WHICH NONPROFIT<br>
<br>
OPERATORS INCLUDING THE PROJECT SPONSORS DON'T SECURE.<br>
<br>
CURRENTLY 45 AGENCIES AND FACILITIES DIRECTED TO<br>
<br>
HOMELESS SUPPORT ARE CLUSTERED WITHIN A THREE BLOCK RADIUS OF<br>
<br>
THIS SITE. SUPERVISOR WALDEN AND MAHMOOD<br>
<br>
HAVE ALREADY SPOKEN TO THIS. JUST TODAY MARSHALL ELEMENTARY<br>
<br>
IS DESIGNATED A SENSITIVE COMMUNITY PER VAGUE AND THE<br>
<br>
PROPOSED SB 50 2000 TO RESIDENT SUPPORTED A HOMELESS CENTER FOR<br>
<br>
160 FIVE CAP WHICH IS MISSION NEIGHBORHOOD RESEARCH CENTER BECAUSE THE HOMELESS PEOPLE ARE ALREADY THERE AS SOON AS THE<br>
<br>
FACILITY OPENED. THE 100 BLOCK OF CAPP WITH THE<br>
<br>
SECTION EIGHT MISSION PLAZA PARKING EGRESS HAS BEEN<br>
<br>
CONTINUALLY BLOCKED BY ADDICTS AND HOMELESS PEOPLE SLEEPING<br>
<br>
IN THE DOORWAYS. >> IN 2015 THE PROJECT RESPECT<br>
<br>
FOR ADDICTS WAS SIGHTED AT ST JOHN'S CHURCH AT 15TH<br>
<br>
AND JULIAN. THIS HAS BECOME A MAGNET FOR DRUG USERS IMMEDIATELY DETERIORATING CONDITIONS AT<br>
<br>
15TH AND JULIAN INCLUDING A FIRE AT THE CHURCH.<br>
<br>
NEARLY 200 DAYS OF OF MISSION LOCAL REPORTING HAS SHOWN THE<br>
<br>
AREA WILL NOT STAY CLEAR AND SAFE UNLESS IT IS<br>
<br>
CONTINUALLY SWEPT BY POLICE. >> WE HAVE OUR SLIDES IN APRIL<br>
<br>
2024 THE CITY WITH THE SUPPORT OF FORMER D9 SUPERVISOR RONEN<br>
<br>
SITED MISSION CABINS AT 1979 MISSION NEXT TO MARSHALL.<br>
<br>
OVER THE OBJECTIONS OF THE MARSHALL COMMUNITY THE MARSHALL<br>
<br>
COMMUNITY OBJECTED BECAUSE WE HAVE SEEN THAT THESE FACILITIES<br>
<br>
ARE MAGNETS ONCE MISSION CABINS WENT IN.<br>
<br>
THE CONDITIONS AROUND THE ENTRANCE WORSENED ONCE CABINS<br>
<br>
ESTABLISHED GUNFIRE BEGINS AND THE BULLETS KEPT FLYING<br>
<br>
AND THE BODIES KEPT PILING UP. ONE OF THE VICTIMS I ACTUALLY<br>
<br>
TOOK CARE OF AT THE HOSPITAL THAT DAY.<br>
<br>
>> TARGET OF GUNFIRE ENTERS MARSHALL AFTER SHOOTING ON CAPP<br>
<br>
STREET. MISSION CABINS STILL CAN'T<br>
<br>
SECURE EAST SIDE OF MISSION STREET. >> ONE PROJECT SPONSOR MISSION HOUSING OWNS LA PHENIX<br>
<br>
AFFORDABLE HOUSING AT 1950 MISSION.<br>
<br>
ALSO A HOME TO A HEADSTART PRE-K PROGRAM.<br>
<br>
>> RESIDENTS OF PHENIX AFFORDABLE HOUSING HAVE ASKED<br>
<br>
TO MOVE TO ANOTHER BUILDING BECAUSE STREET CONDITIONS ARE NO PLACE TO RAISE A FAMILY. HOUSING IS FAILING TO SECURE<br>
<br>
THE HEAD START FACILITY AND ADDICTS HAVE INFILTRATED<br>
<br>
YOUTH SPACES IN A DESPERATE MOVE TO CLEAN UP THEIR ACT<br>
<br>
PRIOR TO THIS HEARING. MISSION HOUSING HAS SCRAMBLED<br>
<br>
TO CLEAN UP THE WEST SIDE OF MISSION BETWEEN 14TH AND 15TH<br>
<br>
STREETS. THIS HAS ONLY DRIVEN ADDICTS ACROSS THE STREET AND FURTHER INTO THE AREA SURROUNDING<br>
<br>
MARSHALL ELEMENTARY SCHOOL. >> MISSION HOUSING DID NOT TAKE<br>
<br>
CARE TO ARCHITECT THE SIDEWALK FRONTAGE OF 1950 MISSION TO<br>
<br>
MINIMIZE THE OPPORTUNITIES FOR BAD ACTORS.<br>
<br>
CAN WE TRUST THEM TO DESIGN THE BART PLAZA FRONTAGE IN THE SUBDIVISION FOR SAFETY WITHOUT HAND-HOLDING?<br>
<br>
THE EVIDENCE INDICATES THAT THESE NONPROFITS WILL NOT<br>
<br>
SECURE PCH AND THAT PCH WILL THUS BE DANGEROUS TO MARSHALL<br>
<br>

WILL FURTHER ENDANGER MARSHALL OUR NEIGHBORHOOD IS ONE OF THE<br>
<br>
FEW THAT HAVE WELCOMED AFFORDABLE HOUSING BUT THE STREAMLINING APPROVALS IS JUST FOR THE SAKE OF STREAMLINING<br>
<br>
BENEFITS FOR DEVELOPERS AND IN AND IN THIS CASE AT THE EXPENSE<br>
<br>
OF OUR COMMUNITY. >> WE DEMAND DENIAL OF THIS<br>
<br>
SUBDIVISION. THANK YOU, SIR. TIMES CONCLUDED. >> THANKS.<br>
<br>
>> THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT. I DON'T SEE COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS FROM COLLEAGUES SO WE<br>
<br>
WILL OPEN UP PUBLIC COMMENT SPECIFICALLY FOR THOSE WHO WANT<br>
<br>
TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF THE APPEAL AND IN OPPOSING MOTION<br>
<br>
TO THE PROJECT. IF FOLKS COULD LINE UP OVER ON<br>
<br>
YOUR RIGHT OF THE ROOM OUR I LEFT AND MADAM CLERK WILL YOU<br>
<br>
PLEASE CALL THE FIRST SPEAKER WE ARE SETTING THE TIMER FOR<br>
<br>
TWO MINUTES. >> WELCOME YOU.<br>
<br>
>> MY NAME IS NAOMI FOX AND I'M A SINGLE MOM OF TWO CHILDREN<br>
<br>
WHO ATTEND MARSHALL ELEMENTARY .<br>
<br>
I'M ALSO A RESIDENT OF THE NEIGHBORHOOD. I HAVE RESIDED ACROSS THE STREET FROM MARSHALL AT 15TH<br>
<br>
AND CAPPS SINCE MAY 2021. SINCE MY OLDEST STARTED KINDERGARTEN I HAVE POURED MY HEART INTO THE SCHOOL COMMUNITY<br>
<br>
VOLUNTEERING FOR EVENTS AND LEADING THE MARSHALL PTA<br>
<br>
AND I'M SO PROUD TO BE A PART OF THIS COMMUNITY.<br>
<br>
I'M ALSO VERY INVOLVED WITH MONTHLY NEIGHBORHOOD MEETINGS WITH THE HRC REPS ABOUT MISSION CABINS.<br>
<br>
WE CAN ALL AGREE THAT THE RATE OF DECAY AROUND 16TH IN MISSION<br>
<br>
AREA HAS ONLY RAMPED UP IN THE PAST FEW YEARS.<br>
<br>
GANGS OF DRUG USERS NOW CROWD OUR STREETS IN ALLEYS AND DRUG<br>
<br>
MARKETS AND FILL OUR SIDEWALKS. IT'S BEEN VERY SCARY FOR ME<br>
<br>
ESPECIALLY AS A MOM. EVEN ON THE WAY HERE I SAW A<br>
<br>
GROUP OF FENTANYL USERS ON THE FRONT STEPS OF MARSHALL.<br>
<br>
THIS IS A VERY, VERY COMMON THING I SEE MULTIPLE TIMES<br>
<br>
EVERY DAY. SMALL GROUPS OF DRUG USERS CLUSTERED ON OUR SIDEWALKS. >> LAST MONTH ON THE MORNING OF<br>
<br>
THE ANNUAL MARSHALL FIELD DAY THERE WERE GUNSHOTS ON THE<br>
<br>
BLOCK AND THE TARGET TOOK REFUGE WITHIN THE MARSHALL<br>
<br>
SCHOOLYARD. MY OWN CHILD COULD EASILY HAVE BEEN CAUGHT IN THE CROSSFIRE. THAT WAS A CLOSE CALL AND I<br>
<br>
BELIEVE THAT ONLY MORE VIOLENCE IS COMING UNTIL THE DRUG<br>
<br>
MARKETS ARE SHUT. THE POPULATION SERVED BY THIS<br>
<br>
PASSAGE WILL FEED THIS DRUG MARKET AND HOUSING THEM IN THAT<br>
<br>
CHAOS IS TRULY A DISSERVICE TO THOSE SEEKING RECOVERY.<br>
<br>
ON MAY 16TH PRINCIPAL NOAH WHO IS HERE TODAY INVITED MATTER<br>
<br>
AND MISSION HOUSING TO COME TO MARSHALL TO TALK ABOUT THIS<br>
<br>
PROJECT AND THE CAFETERIA WAS PACKED WITH MARSHALL PARENTS<br>
<br>
AND STAFF. ONE AFTER ANOTHER PARENTS STOOD<br>
<br>
UP AND BRAVELY VOICED THEIR CONCERNS ABOUT THIS PROJECT<br>
<br>
AND I SAW HOW MUCH STRESS THIS HAS BEEN PUTTING US ALL UNDER.<br>
<br>
AND I FEEL IT TOO. AND IT'S VERY SAD WHEN CHILDREN DON'T WANT TO WALK TO SCHOOL BECAUSE OF WHAT THEY MIGHT SEE<br>
<br>
ON THE WAY THERE. >> I BELIEVE THE COMMUNICATION<br>
<br>
FROM THE DEVELOPERS HAS BEEN VERY POOR.<br>
<br>
IT TOOK OVER TWO MONTHS TO REPLY TO OUR EMAIL ABOUT THANK<br>
<br>
YOU FOR YOUR COMMENTS. >> WELCOME TO OUR NEXT SPEAKER<br>
<br>
. HELLO THERE BOARD. MY NAME IS TODD. I WAS A FORMER MARSHALL PARENT<br>
<br>
AND MARSHALL PTA LEADER. THE PRESIDENT FOR TWO YEARS<br>
<br>
AND I WAS VERY HONORED TO DO THAT. BUT I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE TO CENTER THE NEEDS OF THE<br>
<br>
MARSHALL FAMILIES AND THE COMMUNITY MEMBERS WHO ALL THE<br>
<br>
TIME EXPRESS WHAT DIFFICULT CIRCUMSTANCES THEY HAVE TO<br>
<br>
ENDURE TO GET TO SCHOOL TO PROTECT THEIR CHILDREN FROM<br>
<br>
SEEING THE THINGS THAT THEY SEE ON A DAILY BASIS.<br>
<br>
AND YOU KNOW, I'M VERY THANKFUL THAT THE MAYOR HAS RAISED SOME OF THOSE CONCERNS AND I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE DO EVERYTHING<br>
<br>
IN OUR POWER TO, YOU KNOW, CENTER THE NEEDS OF THE<br>
<br>
FAMILIES WHO DEFINITELY YOU KNOW, THERE'S A LOT OF HOMELESS<br>
<br>
FAMILIES AT MARSHALL AND THEY NEED HOUSING AND DEFINITELY YOU<br>
<br>
KNOW, I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE UNDERSTAND HOW IMPORTANT THAT IS AND THAT, YOU KNOW, WE REALIZE THAT, YOU KNOW, THE<br>
<br>
CONVENIENT THING TO JUST ACCEPT MONEY FOR PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE<br>
<br>
HOUSING FOR YOU KNOW, CERTAIN MEMBERS OF THE COMMUNITY IS NOT<br>
<br>
WHAT THE COMMUNITY HAS SAID THAT THEY REALLY NEED<br>
<br>
AND THAT'S THAT YOU KNOW, THESE THESE FAMILIES WHO ARE OFTEN<br>
<br>
HOUSING INSECURE. AND YOU KNOW I THINK SUPERVISOR<br>
<br>
FIELDER FOR HER WORK IN YOU KNOW BRINGING THAT TO PEOPLE'S<br>
<br>
ATTENTION BUT I THINK WHEN IT COMES TO THIS PROJECT WE SHOULD<br>
<br>
ALSO BE FOCUSED ON THE NEEDS OF THE COMMUNITY RATHER THAN JUST<br>
<br>
AN EASY WIN FOR, YOU KNOW, THESE DEVELOPERS.<br>
<br>
>> SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU FOR YOUR COMMENTS.<br>
<br>
>> LET'S WELCOME OUR NEXT SPEAKER. JUST A NOTE TO THE MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC IN THE PUBLIC<br>
<br>
GALLERY IF YOU ARE IN SUPPORT YOU CAN JUST QUIETLY RAISE YOUR<br>
<br>
HANDS AND WE HAVE A BOARD RULE THAT THERE ARE NO AUDIBLE<br>
<br>
SOUNDS TO INTERRUPT THE PROCEEDING.<br>
<br>
>> WELCOME TO THE NEXT SPEAKER. HI. MY NAME IS MARIANNA AND I'M THE COMMUNITY SCHOOLS COORDINATOR<br>
<br>
AT MARSHALL ELEMENTARY WHICH SITS JUST STEPS FROM THE<br>
<br>
PROPOSED DEVELOPMENT SITE. I'M HERE TODAY NOT AS AN<br>
<br>
OPPONENT OF HOUSING BUT TO SPEAK FOR THE CHILDREN OF<br>
<br>
MARSHALL ELEMENTARY CHILDREN WHO ARE ALREADY SOME OF THE MOST VULNERABLE IN SAN FRANCISCO.<br>
<br>
OVER 30% OF OUR STUDENTS AT MARSHALL QUALIFY AS UNHOUSED.<br>
<br>
THESE ARE CHILDREN WHO COME TO SCHOOL HUNGRY, TIRED, TRAUMATIZED. AND YET THEY STILL SHOW UP<br>
<br>
TRYING TO LEARN WHAT THEY NEED MOST IS STABILITY, SAFETY<br>
<br>
AND SUPPORT. BUT WHAT WE'VE SEEN JUST<br>
<br>
OUTSIDE OF OUR SCHOOL TELLS A DIFFERENT STORY.<br>
<br>
I HAVE PERSONALLY HAD TO CALL SECURITY WHEN TWO PEOPLE WERE<br>
<br>
DEFECATING NEAR OUR FRONT DOORS. >> I'VE WATCHED CHILDREN BE AFRAID TO WALK ON THE SCHOOL<br>
<br>
SIDEWALK BECAUSE OF PEOPLE INJECTING IN FRONT OF OUR GATE.<br>
<br>
ONE DAY A HOMELESS MAN WAS IN PLAIN SIGHT OF STUDENTS.<br>
<br>
THESE ARE NOT ONE OFF INCIDENTS. THEY ARE PART OF THE DAILY LANDSCAPE OF STUDENTS WHO ARE<br>
<br>
FORCED TO WALK THROUGH. I WANT HOUSING BUT I WANT IT<br>
<br>
FOR FAMILIES FOR STUDENTS WHO DON'T HAVE A BED TO SLEEP IN.<br>
<br>
>> FOR THE PARENTS WHO WANT TO STAY IN THE MISSION BUT CAN'T<br>
<br>
AFFORD TO RENT. THIS PROJECT DOESN'T PROMISE<br>
<br>
THAT IT PROMISES PERMANENCE, SUPPORTIVE HOUSING FOR ADULTS<br>
<br>
WITH SUBSTANCE ABUSE AND OTHER COMPLEX NEEDS BUT GIVES NOTHING<br>
<br>
TO THE FAMILIES IN OUR COMMUNITY WHO ARE ALREADY DOING<br>
<br>
EVERYTHING THEY CAN TO SURVIVE. >> I'M ASKING YOU TO PAUSE<br>
<br>
AND REEXAMINE WHETHER THIS LOCATION NEXT TO A TITLE ONE<br>
<br>
ELEMENTARY SCHOOL FILLED WITH TRAUMA IMPACTED CHILDREN IS THE<br>
<br>
RIGHT PLACE FOR THIS TYPE OF HOUSING. WE NEED HOUSING THAT SUPPORTS FAMILIES, NOT ONE THAT RISKS<br>
<br>
RETRAUMATIZING OUR STUDENTS. PLEASE DON'T FORGET THE<br>
<br>
CHILDREN IN THIS CONVERSATION. THEY MAY NOT BE HERE TODAY BUT<br>
<br>
I AM HERE ON THEIR BEHALF. THANK YOU.<br>
<br>
>> THANK YOU FOR YOUR COMMENTS. WELCOME. OUR NEXT SPEAKER. IF YOU WOULD PLEASE HOLD YOUR<br>
<br>
APPLAUSE. WELCOME, SIR.<br>
<br>
>> HI BOARD. MY NAME IS GEORGE AND I'VE LIVED IN THE INTERMISSION FOR 34 YEARS.<br>
<br>
23 OF THEM RIGHT AROUND THE CORNER FROM THE MARSHALL SCHOOL. AND I WON'T REITERATE WHAT ALL<br>
<br>
THE OTHER SPEAKERS HAVE SAID OR THE APPELLANTS HAVE SAID BECAUSE IT SPEAKS FOR ITSELF. THE NEWS ARTICLES SPEAK FOR<br>
<br>
ITSELF. I'VE SEEN IT. I HAVE EXPERIENCED IT THE FIRST TIME THAT I EVER GOT OFFICIAL<br>
<br>
INFORMATION THAT THE PLANS WERE CHANGED TO BUILD AFFORDABLE<br>
<br>
HOUSING RIGHT FOR FAMILIES. WAS THIS LETTER FROM DPW?<br>
<br>
IT WAS DATED JUNE 25TH. I RECEIVED IT IN THE BEGINNING<br>
<br>
OF JULY. MY UNDERSTANDING IS THE PROJECT<br>
<br>
WAS ALREADY APPROVED BY THE PLANNING DEPARTMENT IN MAY.<br>
<br>
I WASN'T INFORMED OF THAT. I WASN'T INFORMED OF ANY<br>
<br>
COMMUNITY MEETINGS TO DISCUSS PLANS TO CHANGE THE PLANS FOR<br>
<br>
THE PARCEL TO DEVELOP THIS HOUSING FOR DRUG USERS<br>
<br>
AND HOMELESS PEOPLE. I WAS INFORMED MOST OF MY<br>
<br>
NEIGHBORS WERE NOT INFORMED SO I DON'T UNDERSTAND THAT THAT'S<br>
<br>
A LACK OF TRANSPARENCY AND IT'S VERY DISRESPECTFUL.<br>
<br>
SO WHAT I WOULD LIKE THE BOARD TO DO IS TO GRANT THE APPEAL<br>
<br>
AND GIVE US THE STAKEHOLDERS TIME TO FIND OUT WHAT'S REALLY<br>
<br>
GOING ON AND HAVE ACTUAL INPUT INTO WHAT THESE CHANGES ARE<br>
<br>
BECAUSE IT INVOLVES US TO IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT THE DEVELOPERS<br>
<br>
AND THE SPONSORS OF THE PROGRAM WHO DO NOT LIVE WHERE WE LIVE<br>
<br>
AND THEIR CHILDREN DO NOT GO TO SCHOOL AT MARSHALL.<br>
<br>
>> THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR YOUR COMMENTS.<br>
<br>
>> ALL RIGHT. I'LL JUST MAKE AN ANNOUNCEMENT<br>
<br>
AS IF THIS IS THE LAST SPEAKER ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANT OR THE PROJECT OR WHO IS AGAINST THE PROJECT.<br>
<br>
PLEASE COME ON UP AND GET IN LINE.<br>
<br>
>> WELCOME, SIR. HI. GOOD AFTERNOON. MY NAME IS NOAH INGBER.<br>
<br>
I'M THE PRINCIPAL OF MARSHALL ELEMENTARY.<br>
<br>
SETH USD I WANT TO ECHO WHAT MARIANA MY COWORKER THE<br>
<br>
COMMUNITY SCHOOL'S COORDINATOR WAS SAYING ABOUT I WANT TO SAY<br>
<br>
I AM VERY MUCH FOR I'M A YES IN MY BACKYARD KIND OF PERSON.<br>
<br>
AFFORDABLE HOUSING IS CRUCIAL. WHAT I'M MORE CONCERNED ABOUT<br>
<br>
IS ABOUT THE HOUSING FOR SUBSTANCE ABUSERS SUBSIDIZED<br>
<br>
PEOPLE WITH A HISTORY OF SUBSTANCE ABUSE.<br>
<br>
PUTTING THAT NEXT DOOR TO AN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL I THINK IS<br>
<br>
VERY PROBLEMATIC AND I'M VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THE REALITY OF<br>
<br>
THAT. I'M CONCERNED ABOUT THE HEIGHT<br>
<br>
OF THOSE BUILDINGS THAT ARE GOING TO CAST A SHADOW OVER OUR<br>
<br>
PLAYGROUND LITERALLY. AND THESE ARE STUDENTS THAT ARE<br>
<br>
YOU KNOW, METAPHORICALLY LIVE IN THE SHADOWS AND WE WILL BE<br>
<br>
LITERALLY IN THE SHADOW OF THESE TALLER BUILDINGS MUCH<br>
<br>
TALLER THAN THE CURRENT BUILDINGS IN THE IN THE<br>
<br>
NEIGHBORHOOD. >> BUT IN SHORT, I JUST WANT TO<br>
<br>
BE VERY CLEAR THAT I AM FOR PUBLIC HOUSING ESPECIALLY<br>
<br>
ESPECIALLY FOR FAMILIES THAT OVER 30% LIKE MARIANA SAID OVER<br>
<br>
30% OF OUR FAMILIES AT OUR SCHOOL QUALIFY.<br>
<br>
AND I AM CONCERNED ABOUT THOSE SUBSTANCE ABUSE FOLKS.<br>
<br>
THANK YOU. >> THANK YOU FOR YOUR COMMENTS<br>
<br>
. >> EXCUSE ME. I AM IN SUPPORT OF THIS PEOPLE TALKING ABOUT THE DANGERS THAT<br>
<br>
THEY HAVE TO ENDURE EVERY DAY WITH THEIR CHILDREN. I AM A MOTHER WHO LOST HER CHILD TO HOMICIDE, SHOT 30<br>
<br>
TIMES WITH A SEMIAUTOMATIC GUN. SAVING SOMEONE ELSE'S LIFE.<br>
<br>
I DON'T WANT NONE OF THESE MOTHERS AND FATHERS THAT ARE<br>
<br>
COMING UP HERE AND ASKING FOR JUSTICE AND SAFETY IN THEIR<br>
<br>
NEIGHBORHOODS. BECAUSE WHEN WHEN WHEN CHILDREN<br>
<br>
ARE KILLED WE'RE COUNTING ON THE SYSTEM TO GIVE THEM HOUSING<br>
<br>
SOMEWHERE ELSE BECAUSE OF THE DANGER OF THE RIPPLING EFFECT<br>
<br>
OF IT. AND WHO WANTS TO WALK AND TAKE<br>
<br>
THEIR KIDS TO SCHOOL IN A DANGEROUS NEIGHBORHOOD?<br>
<br>
WHO WANTS TO DO THAT? THESE PEOPLE NEED HELP.<br>
<br>
I NEED HELP. >> SO I'M THINKING EVEN NEXT<br>
<br>
MONTH IT WILL BE THE ANNIVERSARY OF MY SON'S DEATH. WHO WAS MURDERED IN SAN FRANCISCO ON SAN FRANCISCO<br>
<br>
STREETS. >> SO I ASK FOR ALL THE SUPPORT<br>
<br>
THAT THESE PEOPLE ARE ASKING FOR FOR YOU TO SHOW UP AND AND<br>
<br>
GIVE US MOTHERS SOME SUPPORT AND SOME FATHERS SOME SUPPORT.<br>
<br>
I AGREE WITH YOU. >> THAT ARE THAT ARE HERE<br>
<br>
TALKING ABOUT THE SCHOOL THE MARSHALL SCHOOL.<br>
<br>
>> I HAD A CHILD THAT WENT OVER TO THAT SCHOOL ALSO AND THE<br>
<br>
PAST SHE'S AN ADULT NOW. BUT I UNDERSTAND THAT YOU DON'T<br>
<br>
HAVE TO BE TAKING YOUR KIDS TO SCHOOL IN A DANGEROUS NEIGHBORHOOD. PLEASE HELP THEM.<br>
<br>
HELP ME. I'M A MOTHER WHO LOST A CHILD.<br>
<br>
SO JUST GETTING UP HERE SUPPORTING THEM AND HEARING<br>
<br>
THAT THE FIT NOW AND THE DRUGS IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD IS NOT<br>
<br>
GOOD. SO PLEASE THINK ABOUT THEM.<br>
<br>
THINK ABOUT ME. I'VE BEEN COMING HERE FOR YEARS<br>
<br>
ASKING FOR SUPPORT FOR YEARS. YOU GUYS ARE NEW COMMISSIONERS<br>
<br>
. SO NOW I GOT TO GET TO KNOW YOU AND WHICH IS OKAY. >> I CAN'T LET MY SON'S HIS<br>
<br>
DEATH BE NOTHING. SO AND I CONGRATULATE THESE<br>
<br>
PEOPLE THAT ARE COMING UP HERE AND ASKING FOR SERVICE.<br>
<br>
>> THANK YOU, MS.. BROWN, FOR YOUR COMMENTS. YES. >> ALL RIGHT.<br>
<br>
LET'S HEAR FROM OUR NEXT SPEAKER. WELCOME. >> GOOD AFTERNOON.<br>
<br>
BART GRIFFIN LEE HERE SPEAKING FROM THE HEART.<br>
<br>
I'M ACTUALLY HERE FOR AN INTRODUCTION WHICH I ACTUALLY<br>
<br>
MAY NOT BE ABLE TO MAKE PUBLIC COMMENT FOR.<br>
<br>
>> I HAVE SOMEWHERE TO BE BUT I DID WANT TO SAY I THINK IF WE<br>
<br>
DO APPROVE THIS PLAN AS IS WHICH INCLUDES PERMANENT<br>
<br>
SUPPORTIVE HOUSING, THERE'S A VERY GOOD CHANCE IT WILL<br>
<br>
CONTRADICT A RESOLUTION THAT WAS ACTUALLY INTRODUCED LAST<br>
<br>
WEEK THAT I'M VERY SUPPORTIVE OF WHICH IS ALLOWING FOR<br>
<br>
PRIORITY CALLS FOR DRUG USE AROUND PARKS AND SCHOOLS.<br>
<br>
>> WELL, THIS HOUSING DEVELOPMENT WOULD BE RIGHT DOWN<br>
<br>
THE STREET FROM AN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL AND THERE WOULD BE A<br>
<br>
HIGH PROBABILITY OF OF CONTINUED DRUG ACTIVITY ALONG<br>
<br>
WITH THOSE LIVING IN PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING IN THAT<br>
<br>
DEVELOPMENT. >> GIVEN WE KNOW THE NATURE OF<br>
<br>
WHAT'S HAPPENING IN A LOT OF OUR HOUSING TODAY, JUST LOOK AT THE DATA AND OUR OVERDOSE DEATHS.<br>
<br>
>> SO I THINK WE GOT TO RETHINK ABOUT THIS THIS PROPOSAL.<br>
<br>
I'M VERY MUCH SUPPORTIVE OF SUPPORT OF AH EXCUSE ME<br>
<br>
AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND I WOULDN'T LET THE SHADOW TOPIC<br>
<br>
GET IN THE WAY OF BUILDING HOUSING.<br>
<br>
I THINK WE SAW WHAT HAPPENED ON FIFTH AND MISSION WHICH IS NOW<br>
<br>
A DRUG CRISIS CENTER OR A TRIAGE CENTER SO THAT'S MY<br>
<br>
$0.02. I WOULD RECONSIDER THE APPROVAL<br>
<br>
TO ELIMINATE PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING GIVEN IT'S<br>
<br>
DOWN THE STREET FROM A SCHOOL. >> THANKS SO MUCH. THANK YOU FOR YOUR COMMENTS. BEFORE THE NEXT SPEAKER, IF<br>
<br>
THERE'S ANYONE IN THE CHAMBER WHO IS HERE TO SPEAK ON BEHALF<br>
<br>
OF THE APPELLANT OR IF YOU ARE AGAINST THE PROJECT NOW WOULD<br>
<br>
BE YOUR OPPORTUNITY TO PROVIDE THE BOARD YOUR COMMENTS.<br>
<br>
>> OTHERWISE THIS WILL BE OUR LAST SPEAKER. WELCOME. YES. OKAY. IT'S WHAT GEORGE SAYS OVER<br>
<br>
THERE ABOUT NOT HAVING A TIME TO FOR THE NOTIFICATION TO<br>
<br>
ARRIVE ON TIME TO ANALYZE EXACTLY WHAT'S WHAT'S GOING ON.<br>
<br>
>> THAT'S WHY YOU APPEAL THE REST AND THEN YOU HAVE TIME TO<br>
<br>
CONSIDER THAT IN FACT THERE IS NO PROB OKAY.<br>
<br>
THESE GUYS DRUG ADDICTS ARE NOT A PROBLEM FOR KIDS SPECIFICALLY<br>
<br>
THEY ARE NOT THE PEDOPHILES AND PEDOPHILES ARE NOT IN THE<br>
<br>
STREETS. SO YOU WORK TOGETHER SINCE YOU WORK IN PROGRESS IN PROXIMITY OF EACH OTHER, YOU WORK<br>
<br>
TOGETHER. YOU ASK THESE DRUG ADDICTS TO<br>
<br>
ADD THE KIDS. IN FACT THEY'RE GOING TO LOVE IT BECAUSE AT LEAST THAT FOR USEFUL AND IT'S DONE YOU NEED<br>
<br>
TO WORK TOGETHER NOT SEPARATE YOU KNOW NO RACISM ALWAYS.<br>
<br>
>> HMM. IS THIS CLEAR? YOU APPEAL MEANWHILE JUST TO HAVE TIME TO SEE THE SITUATION<br>
<br>
PRECISELY TO SIMPLIFY YOU. >> THANK YOU FOR YOUR COMMENTS,<br>
<br>
MR. PRESIDENT. >> ALL RIGHT.<br>
<br>
PUBLIC COMMENT IN SUPPORT OF THE APPEAL IS NOW CLOSED AND WE<br>
<br>
ARE NOW GOING TO HEAR FROM REPRESENTATIVES OF CITY DEPARTMENTS FOR UP TO TEN MINUTES AND I THINK WE ARE<br>
<br>
STARTING WITH A LIST FRENCH FROM PUBLIC WORKS MAYBE.<br>
<br>
>> CAN YOU HEAR ME? HI THERE.<br>
<br>
MY NAME IS ELIAS FRENCH. I'M HERE ON BEHALF OF ELIAS.<br>
<br>
>> CAN YOU SPEAK DIRECTLY INTO THAT MICROPHONE?<br>
<br>
>> SURE. IT MOVES SO JUST DIRECTED TOWARDS. GOT IT.<br>
<br>
I'M HERE ON BEHALF OF DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC WORKS AS<br>
<br>
THE CITY AND COUNTY SURVEYOR WHERE THE AGENCY THAT PROCESSES<br>
<br>
SUBDIVISION MAP APPLICATIONS IN SAN FRANCISCO.<br>
<br>
I'LL GIVE A BRIEF OUTLINE OF THE PROJECTS PROCESS IN THROUGH<br>
<br>
OUR OFFICE. WE RECEIVED THE SUBDIVISION<br>
<br>
APPLICATION AND TENTATIVE PARCEL MAP ON JANUARY 25TH.<br>
<br>
IT WAS DEEMED SUBMITTED WELL CIRCULATED TO CITY AGENCIES<br>
<br>
AND APPROVED BY PLANNING. >> ON MAY 28TH 2025.<br>
<br>
AT THAT TIME FOLLOWING THAT OUR OF OUR DEPARTMENT AFTER<br>
<br>
REVIEWING THE TENTATIVE MAP AND ITS OWN CAPACITY ISSUED<br>
<br>
TENTATIVE MAP APPROVAL AT THAT TIME WE NOTIFIED THE NEIGHBORS<br>
<br>
AS REQUIRED AND THEREAFTER RECEIVED A NOTICE OF THIS<br>
<br>
APPEAL BASED ON OUR REVIEW OF THE SUBDIVISION WHICH PROPOSES<br>
<br>
THE SUBDIVISION OF THE EXISTING PARCEL INTO THREE PARCELS.<br>
<br>
WE FOUND THAT COMPLIANT WITH THE APPLICABLE RULES AND CODES<br>
<br>
. THE PLANNING DEPARTMENT FOUND IT SIMILARLY COMPLIANT WITH REGARD TO THE GENERAL PLAN LOT<br>
<br>
SIZE AND ETC. THE APPELLANT'S LETTER AND THE CONCERNS HERE<br>
<br>
RELATE TO THE TYPE OF HOUSING PROPOSED ON THE SITE THE SIZE<br>
<br>
SHAPE OF THE BUILDINGS ETC. AND CONCERNS RELATED TO THOSE.<br>
<br>
THESE MATTERS AREN'T DIRECTLY RELATED TO THE SUBDIVISION OF<br>
<br>
THE PARCEL ITSELF BUT RATHER TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE<br>
<br>
STRUCTURES ON THE SITE WHICH IS NOT WHAT THE SUBDIVISION MAP<br>
<br>
INVOLVES. THEREFORE I FIND THE IN OUR<br>
<br>
OPINION THE CONCERNS RAISED OUR PLANNING RELATED WITH REGARD TO<br>
<br>
THE PROPOSED CONSTRUCTION WHICH ARE APPROVED THROUGH THE<br>
<br>
PLANNING PROCESS AND BUILDING PERMITTING PROCESS NOT THE<br>
<br>
SUBDIVISION PROCESS. I WILL DEFER THE REST OF MY<br>
<br>
TIME TO THE PLANNING DEPARTMENT WHO I BELIEVE HAS A<br>
<br>
PRESENTATION OR CAN EXPLAIN FURTHER UNLESS THERE ARE ANY<br>
<br>
QUESTIONS AT THIS TIME NO QUESTIONS.<br>
<br>
>> GOOD AFTERNOON PRESIDENT MADAM AND MEMBERS OF THE BOARD.<br>
<br>
MY NAME IS ERIN STAR MANAGER OF LEGISLATIVE AFFAIRS AT THE<br>
<br>
PLANNING DEPARTMENT. I'LL GIVE A BRIEF OVERVIEW OF THE PROJECT AND HOW THE SUBDIVISION COMPLIES WITH THE<br>
<br>
PLANNING CODE AND THEN ADDRESS THE ISSUES RAISED BY THE APPELLANTS. THE PROJECT PROPOSES TO<br>
<br>
SUBDIVIDE A 57,325 SQUARE FOOT PARCEL INTO THREE NEW LOTS<br>
<br>
MEASURING APPROXIMATELY 24,000 718,000 713,800FT2.<br>
<br>
>> IT INCLUDES THE DEMOLITION OF AN EXISTING COMMERCIAL<br>
<br>
BUILDING AND THE CONSTRUCTION OF A NINE STOREY RESIDENTIAL BUILDING WITH 136 UNITS OF SUPPORTIVE HOUSING.<br>
<br>
>> THIS PROJECT WAS SUBMITTED UNDER AB 2162 WHICH ALLOWS FOR<br>
<br>
THE MINISTERIAL APPROVAL OF SUPPORTIVE HOUSING DEVELOPMENTS<br>
<br>
. THE PLANNING DEPARTMENT DETERMINED THE PROJECT MET ALL APPLICABLE REQUIREMENTS<br>
<br>
AND ISSUED APPROVALS ACCORDINGLY. THE TENTATIVE MAP WAS SUBSEQUENTLY APPROVED FOR<br>
<br>
COMPLIANCE WITH THE PLANNING CODE UNDER PLANNING CODE<br>
<br>
SECTION 121. ALL NEW LOTS MUST MEET MINIMUM STANDARDS FOR AREA WIDTH AND FRONTAGE.<br>
<br>
SPECIFICALLY EACH LOT MUST ONE HAVE A MINIMUM OF WIDTH OF 20FT<br>
<br>
HAVE AT LEAST 16FT OF FRONTAGE ON A STREET OR ALLEYWAY AND A<br>
<br>
MINIMUM AREA OF 1200 SQUARE FEET.<br>
<br>
THE PROPOSED SUBDIVISION MEETS ALL OF THESE OBJECTIVE<br>
<br>
STANDARDS. I WILL GO AHEAD AND SKIP THE<br>
<br>
FIRST TWO CONCERNS THAT THE APPELLANT RAISED IN THEIR APPLICATION SINCE THEY HAVE WITHDRAWN THEM.<br>
<br>
BUT THE LAST ONE THE APPELLANT EXPRESSED CONCERNS ABOUT PUBLIC<br>
<br>
SAFETY, HOMELESSNESS AND NEIGHBORHOOD CONDITIONS.<br>
<br>
WHILE WE ACKNOWLEDGE THE SERIOUSNESS OF THESE ISSUES, THEY ARE NOT FACTORS THAT GOVERN THE REVIEW OR APPROVAL<br>
<br>
OF A TENTATIVE MAP. SUBDIVISIONS THE SUBDIVISION<br>
<br>
DOES NOT CAUSE OR MITIGATE THESE BROADER SOCIAL CONCERNS.<br>
<br>
IN SUMMARY THE ISSUES RAISED IN THE APPEAL FOCUS ON THE<br>
<br>
BROADER DEVELOPMENT NOT ON WHAT THE TENTATIVE MAP WAS, NOT IF<br>
<br>
THE TENTATIVE MAP WAS PROPERLY APPROVED.<br>
<br>
THE PLANNING DEPARTMENT HAS DETERMINED THAT THE SUBDIVISION<br>
<br>
COMPLIES WITH THE PLANNING CODE AND THE GENERAL PLAN. NO EVIDENCE HAS BEEN PRESENTED TO INDICATE THAT THE CITY ERRED<br>
<br>
IN APPROVING THE TENTATIVE MAP .<br>
<br>
WE RESPECTFULLY RECOMMEND UPHOLDING THE PLANNING DEPARTMENT AND DPW DECISION TO APPROVE THE TENTATIVE MAP.<br>
<br>
THAT CONCLUDES MY PRESENTATION. I'M AVAILABLE FOR QUESTIONS.<br>
<br>
I ALSO HAVE MY COLLEAGUE CARLY GROBE HERE WHO CAN ANSWER<br>
<br>
QUESTIONS ABOUT THE APPROVAL OF THE DEVELOPMENT PROJECT.<br>
<br>
>> THANK YOU. >> I DO NOT SEE ANY HELP.<br>
<br>
>> SUPERVISOR FIELDER. THANK YOU.<br>
<br>
>> I JUST HAVE A COUPLE QUESTIONS. UM, SO FOR FOR DPW WHAT ARE THE CRITERIA THAT PUBLIC WORKS<br>
<br>
CONSIDERS IN APPROVING A PARCEL MAP?<br>
<br>
>> ELI FRENCH COUNTY SURVEYOR. THE CRITERIA THAT PUBLIC WORKS<br>
<br>
CONSIDERS WHEN APPROVING A PARCEL MAP ARE WE REVIEWED THE<br>
<br>
TENTATIVE MAP FOR TECHNICAL CORRECTNESS AND THE THE<br>
<br>
PROPOSED PARCEL IS ASIAN FOR CONFORMANCE WITH THE GENERAL<br>
<br>
PLAN. AND ALSO INTAKE THE COMMENTS<br>
<br>
FROM PLANNING WITH REGARD TO THAT CONFORMANCE.<br>
<br>
THOSE ARE THE APPROVAL IS LARGELY TECHNICAL AND DOESN'T<br>
<br>
HINGE ON ANALYSIS OF THE TYPES OF CONCERNS THAT WERE RAISED<br>
<br>
HERE. >> THANK YOU.<br>
<br>
AND THEN PLANNING. >> SO YOU PLANNING APPROVE THIS<br>
<br>
PROJECT ON MAY 27TH? >> CORRECT.<br>
<br>
YES, I BELIEVE SO. >> CAN YOU SPEAK TO THIS<br>
<br>
PROJECT'S COMPLIANCE WITH OUR GENERAL PLAN AND SPECIFICALLY<br>
<br>
POLICY? 1526 AND PLANNING CODE<br>
<br>
SUBSECTION 1A1 POINT 1B4 AS LAID OUT IN YOUR APPROVAL<br>
<br>
LETTER. >> I'M SORRY, COULD YOU REPEAT<br>
<br>
THE NUMBERS AGAIN? SO SPECIFICALLY POLICY 1526<br>
<br>
AND PLANNING CODE SUBSECTION 1A1 POINT 1B4.<br>
<br>
>> SO THE WHAT I WANT BEFORE IS RELATED TO COMMUTER TRAFFIC NOT<br>
<br>
IMPEDING MUNI TRANSIT OR OVERBURDEN OUR STREETS OR<br>
<br>
NEIGHBORHOOD PARKING. >> CORRECT.<br>
<br>
SO WE FOUND THAT THE PROJECT AS DESIGNED WOULD NOT DO THAT.<br>
<br>
>> OKAY. DID PLANNING APPROVE A WAIVER<br>
<br>
FOR USABLE OPEN SPACE FOR THIS PROJECT?<br>
<br>
>> I WILL DEFER TO MY COLLEAGUE ON THAT. THANK THANK YOU. >> YES.<br>
<br>
YES WE DID. >> THANK YOU.<br>
<br>
AND LASTLY THE DENSITY OF THE PROJECT IS UNDER PLANNING<br>
<br>
PURVIEW. HOW DID PLANNING COMPLY WITH THE STATE DENSITY BONUS LAW IN APPROVING THIS PROJECT?<br>
<br>
>> KALI GROVE PLANNING DEPARTMENT STAFF.<br>
<br>
THE STATE DENSITY BONUS LAW PROVIDES 100% AFFORDABLE<br>
<br>
HOUSING PROJECTS UNLIMITED DENSITY AND UP TO THREE STORIES<br>
<br>
ABOVE THE ZONE HEIGHT LIMIT AS WELL AS WAIVERS AND INCENTIVES<br>
<br>
AND CONCESSIONS FROM CERTAIN PLANNING CODE STANDARDS.<br>
<br>
SO THE UNDERLYING DENSITY OF THE SITE IS ALREADY RELATIVELY<br>
<br>
HIGH BECAUSE OF THE FORM BASED ZONING FOR THE PROJECT.<br>
<br>
SO A CODE COMPLIANT PROJECT HERE COULD BUILD UP TO 105FT<br>
<br>
YOU KNOW WITH CERTAIN SETBACKS ASSUMED.<br>
<br>
SO ESSENTIALLY THE PROJECT USED PROVISIONS OF THE STATE DENSITY<br>
<br>
BONUS THAT ARE ALLOWED BY THE STATE LAW FOR 100% AFFORDABLE<br>
<br>
PROJECTS TO ACHIEVE THE DENSITY. >> THANK YOU. >> AND THEN I WANTED TO BRING<br>
<br>
THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING DEVELOPERS UP FOR A QUESTION.<br>
<br>
I JUST WANTED TO ASK A QUESTION ABOUT WHAT OUTREACH TO THE<br>
<br>
COMMUNITY HAS BEEN LIKE DURING THE DEVELOPMENT PROCESS.<br>
<br>
>> THEY ALSO WILL BE DOING A WHOLE PRESENTATION ON IT.<br>
<br>
>> YEAH WE CAN SAY THAT THEM. DO YOU WANT ME TO ANSWER?<br>
<br>
DO YOU WANT ME TO WAIT FOR THE PRESENTATION? YOU'RE UP. HI.<br>
<br>
SAM WAS THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF MISSION HOUSING DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION, OUR PARTNER HERE. >> PLEASE GO AHEAD.<br>
<br>
GOOD AFTERNOON, LA RAZA. I'M SPEAKING ON BEHALF OF<br>
<br>
MARRIOTT MISSION INCOME ANOMIC DEVELOPMENT AGENCY FROM THE<br>
<br>
YEARS BEFORE THIS WAS AN RFQ PLAZA DIOCESE'S MISSION HOUSING<br>
<br>
MISSION ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AGENCY.<br>
<br>
>> WE'RE WORKING WITH COMMUNITY TALKING WITH COMMUNITY.<br>
<br>
THE RFQ ITSELF WAS INFORMED BY COMMUNITY AFTER DOZENS OF<br>
<br>
MEETINGS AFTER IT WAS AWARDED. FOR THE BETTER PART OF TWO<br>
<br>
YEARS WE HAD BOTH SMALL AND LARGE MEETINGS.<br>
<br>
>> WE HAD MULTIPLE MEETINGS WHICH WERE PUBLICIZED IN THE<br>
<br>
PRESS ABOUT THE DENSITY AND THE HEIGHT. WE HAD A COMMUNITY VOTE OVER THE COURSE OF THREE SEPARATE<br>
<br>
MEETINGS. THE COMMUNITY VOTED FOR AS TALL<br>
<br>
AND AS MUCH AFFORDABLE HOUSING FOR FAMILIES AND HOMELESS INDIVIDUALS AS POSSIBLE. BUT I DO BEFORE I SEE IT, I<br>
<br>
JUST WANT TO SAY THIS ISN'T GOING TO STOP COMMUNITY<br>
<br>
OUTREACH. WE PLAN ON HAVING MEETINGS A<br>
<br>
LOT BOTH BEFORE DURING CONSTRUCTION AND THEN AFTER THE<br>
<br>
BUILDING IS BUILT THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE LIFETIME OF THE BUILDING. IT'S SOMETHING BOTH MISSION<br>
<br>
AND MEDICARE A LOT ABOUT. AND WE HAVE OVER 50 YEARS TRACK<br>
<br>
RECORD PROVING THANK YOU. I WOULD ALSO ADD THAT WE MET<br>
<br>
WITH THE SCHOOL COMMUNITY AS WELL AND WE ARE COMMITTED<br>
<br>
AND TAKE VERY SERIOUSLY THEIR CONCERNS.<br>
<br>
>> ANY DEVELOPMENT YOUR SCHOOL CAN BRING YOU KNOW, POSITIVE<br>
<br>
AND ALSO DIFFICULT SITUATIONS THAT WE ARE COMMITTED COMMITTED<br>
<br>
TO ADDRESSING AND WORKING WITH THE COMMUNITY TO MAKE SURE THAT<br>
<br>
AREA IS AN ASSET TO THE COMMUNITY.<br>
<br>
>> THANK YOU. BACK TO YOU. PRESIDENT. >> THANK YOU.<br>
<br>
SUPERVISOR FIELDER. AND JUST SO I UNDERSTAND KIND<br>
<br>
OF ALL THAT'S GOING INTO THIS. >> I MEAN WHAT'S IN FRONT OF US<br>
<br>
TODAY IS OH YOU GUYS CAN SIT DOWN.<br>
<br>
UH, WE HAVE A WE HAVE A MAP APPEAL.<br>
<br>
YOU'VE TALKED TO US SOME ABOUT THE PLANNING APPROVALS OF THOSE<br>
<br>
WERE NONDISCRETIONARY, RIGHT. SO THERE WAS NOT REALLY A PLACE<br>
<br>
FOR THE PLANNING DEPARTMENT TO THINK ABOUT AS A POLICY MATTER<br>
<br>
WHETHER THIS IS A GOOD OR BAD IDEA.<br>
<br>
SO THE ONLY DISCRETION ON THE CITY SIDE HERE IS ON FUNDING<br>
<br>
WHICH PRESUMABLY THERE IS FUNDING FOR THIS PROJECT BUT<br>
<br>
THAT'S NOT FROM ANY OF YOU. RIGHT?<br>
<br>
I MEAN KIND OF ADAM TALKS ABOUT BUT I'M NOT GOING TO PUT HIM<br>
<br>
IN THE IN THE HOT SEAT. >> OKAY.<br>
<br>
OKAY. ALL RIGHT. THANK YOU. >> ALL RIGHT.<br>
<br>
I DON'T THINK WE HAVE ANY MORE QUESTIONS FOR FOR OUR<br>
<br>
DEPARTMENT. >> SO WITH THAT I'LL CALL UP THE PROJECT SPONSOR TO SPEAK FOR UP TO TEN MINUTES.<br>
<br>
>> GOOD AFTERNOON, SUPERVISORS .<br>
<br>
MY NAME IS SAM MOSS AND THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF MISSION HOUSING DEVELOPMENT CORP MISSION HOUSING HAS BEEN<br>
<br>
BUILDING DEVELOPING AND RUNNING AFFORDABLE HOUSING WITH AND FOR<br>
<br>
COMMUNITY FOR OVER 50 YEARS. WE'RE PROUD TO STAND WITH<br>
<br>
RESIDENTS FAMILIES AND PARTNERS WHO BELIEVE SAN FRANCISCO<br>
<br>
SHOULD BE A PLACE WHERE EVERYONE HAS SECURE, AFFORDABLE<br>
<br>
AND SUSTAINABLE HOUSING. I WANT TO START BY THANKING<br>
<br>
EVERYONE WHO'S HERE TO SUPPORT AFFORDABLE HOUSING.<br>
<br>
THANK YOU. YOUR PRESENCE TRULY MATTERS. THANKS TO THE CITY AGENCIES WHO HAVE SUBMITTED THEIR REPORTS<br>
<br>
ABOUT THE APPEAL. THANK YOU FOR THE COUNTLESS<br>
<br>
RESIDENTS, FAMILIES AND COMMUNITY PARTNERS WHO'VE<br>
<br>
MADE THEIR VOICES HEARD THROUGHOUT THIS PROCESS. WE'RE HERE TODAY NOT JUST TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF A PARCEL<br>
<br>
MAP. WE'RE HERE TO DEFEND THE VERY<br>
<br>
IDEA THAT WORKING CLASS AND LOW INCOME FAMILIES WHO ARE THE BACKBONE OF OUR CITY DESERVE TO LIVE IN SAN FRANCISCO.<br>
<br>
THAT THEY DESERVE THE DIGNITY OF A LASTING HOME A HOME THAT<br>
<br>
ALLOWS THEM TO HAVE THE RIGHT TO REMAIN IN THE NEIGHBORHOODS<br>
<br>
AND THE OPPORTUNITY TO THRIVE IN OUR CITY.<br>
<br>
WE'RE HERE TODAY TO DEFEND THE BELIEF THAT HOUSING IS A HUMAN<br>
<br>
RIGHT. BUILDING AFFORDABLE HOUSING IN THE MISSION SHOULD NOT BE CONTROVERSIAL.<br>
<br>
IT IS ONE OF THE MANY SOLUTIONS TO A DIRE SITUATION.<br>
<br>
IT IS URGENT AND IT IS LONG OVERDUE.<br>
<br>
THIS APPEAL ISN'T ABOUT PROTECTING THE NEIGHBORHOOD.<br>
<br>
IT'S ABOUT PROTECTING PRIVILEGE. IT'S ABOUT USING BUREAUCRACY TO BLOCK EQUITY.<br>
<br>
IT SENDS A CLEAR MESSAGE TO LOW INCOME AND HOUSING INSECURE<br>
<br>
FOLKS IN SAN FRANCISCO. YOU DON'T BELONG HERE.<br>
<br>
>> THAT'S WHAT THIS APPEAL IS REALLY ABOUT AND WE SHOULD CALL IT WHAT IT IS A WEAPONIZATION OF PROCESS IN THE SERVICE OF<br>
<br>
EXCLUSION. THIS ISN'T JUST ABOUT TECHNICAL<br>
<br>
OBJECTIONS. IT'S ABOUT A FEW INDIVIDUALS<br>
<br>
TRYING TO SILENCE THE VOICE OF HUNDREDS OF COMMUNITY MEMBERS,<br>
<br>
UNDERMINE THE CITY'S COMMITMENTS AND BREAK PROMISES MADE TO THIS COMMUNITY. THE APPELLANT IS ARGUING THAT<br>
<br>
SUBDIVIDING ONE LOT INTO THREE SOMEHOW HARMS THE COMMUNITY<br>
<br>
THAT IS SIMPLY FALSE. THIS IS A BACKDOOR ATTEMPT TO<br>
<br>
DELAY DERAIL AND DISCOURAGE THE CREATION OF DESPERATELY NEEDED<br>
<br>
AFFORDABLE HOUSING. AND WE CANNOT LET THAT STAND.<br>
<br>
AND YET HERE WE ARE EVEN DEEP AFFORDABILITY WITH WIDE<br>
<br>
COMMUNITY SUPPORT STILL FACES OBSTRUCTION. AND THIS SHOULD CONCERN ALL OF US.<br>
<br>
THIS MOMENT RAISES AN IMPORTANT AND BROADER QUESTION ONE THAT<br>
<br>
THIS BOARD WILL HAVE TO GRAPPLE WITH. WHAT SYSTEMS NEED TO CHANGE TO PREVENT THE MISUSE OF<br>
<br>
PROCEDURAL STEPS TO BLOCK DESPERATELY NEEDED HOUSING?<br>
<br>
>> WHAT ARE YOU THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS DOING TO ENSURE<br>
<br>
THAT BASIS APPEALS SUCH AS THIS NO LONGER HAPPEN?<br>
<br>
WHAT ARE YOU THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS ARE DOING TO ENSURE<br>
<br>
THAT WE BUILD AND SUPPORT 100% AFFORDABLE HOUSING IN EVERY<br>
<br>
SINGLE NEIGHBORHOOD? BECAUSE IF 100% OF AFFORDABLE<br>
<br>
HOUSING SUPPORTED BY COMMUNITY PARTNERS DESIGNED TO SERVE<br>
<br>
THOSE MOST IN NEED IN A NEIGHBORHOOD DEEPLY IMPACTED BY<br>
<br>
DISPLACEMENT CAN'T MOVE FORWARD WITHOUT BEING ATTACKED<br>
<br>
AND DELAYED, THEN WHAT KIND OF CITY ARE WE BECOMING? EVERY DAY OF DELAY HAS REAL HUMAN COSTS.<br>
<br>
THERE ARE THOUSANDS SLEEPING ON OUR STREETS EVERY NIGHT.<br>
<br>
CHILDREN ARE SLEEPING IN S.F. USD SHELTERS.<br>
<br>
FAMILIES ARE OVERCROWDED CONDITIONS DOUBLING AND TRIPLING UP IN APARTMENTS THEY CAN BARELY AFFORD.<br>
<br>
AND GENERATIONS OF SAN FRANCISCANS HAVE BEEN TOLD THAT<br>
<br>
THEY CAN GROW UP IN THE CITY BUT THEY CAN'T GROW OLD HERE.<br>
<br>
WHILE WE WASTE TIME HERE, THE CRISIS IS JUST GROWING MORE URGENT. THIS ISN'T THEORETICAL.<br>
<br>
THIS CRISIS IS ABOUT REAL PEOPLE, REAL LIVES.<br>
<br>
AND THE MARVEL IS PART OF THAT SOLUTION.<br>
<br>
AND IF YOU CARE ABOUT ECONOMIC RECOVERY, FAMILY STABILITY<br>
<br>
AND REDUCING HOMELESSNESS, THEN BUILD THIS KIND OF HOUSING.<br>
<br>
WE NEED IT NOW. ENOUGH DELAYS, ENOUGH<br>
<br>
OBSTRUCTION, ENOUGH HIDING BEHIND TRAFFIC AND PERCEIVED<br>
<br>
NEIGHBORHOOD CHARACTER WHILE FAMILIES AND INDIVIDUALS SLEEP IN OVERCROWDED CONDITIONS AND SORROWS AND ON GYMNASIUM<br>
<br>
FLOORS. TRUE EQUITY MEANS TAKING ACTION<br>
<br>
WHEN IT MATTERS THE MOST. AND THIS IS ONE OF THOSE<br>
<br>
MOMENTS. AND SO TODAY I ASKED THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS TO DO WHAT'S RIGHT.<br>
<br>
DENY THIS APPEAL. APPROVE THIS SUBDIVISION.<br>
<br>
LET'S BUILD A MARVEL. LET'S BUILD A MORE AFFORDABLE AND INCLUSIVE SAN FRANCISCO. I WANT TO THANK YOU.<br>
<br>
AND NOW PASS IT TO MY COLLEAGUE LAURA GARCIA FROM MICHIGAN<br>
<br>
ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AGENCY. OUR PARTNER ON THE PROJECT.<br>
<br>
>> THANK YOU, SAM. GOOD AFTERNOON, SUPERVISORS<br>
<br>
AND MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC. MARIA IS A PROUD CO-DEVELOPER<br>
<br>
OF LA MARIA THE MARVEL IN THE MISSION. FIRST I WANT TO REMIND US THAT THIS PROJECT IS THE RESULT OF<br>
<br>
OVER A DECADE OF GRASSROOTS ADVOCACY.<br>
<br>
TO MEET THE URGENT NEED FOR HOUSING FOR WORKING FAMILIES<br>
<br>
IN SAN FRANCISCO, MARIA IS PROUD TO HELP DELIVER OVER 300<br>
<br>
UNITS OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING TO THE MISSION A NEIGHBORHOOD THAT<br>
<br>
HAS LONG BEEN HOME TO WORKING CLASS FAMILIES.<br>
<br>
AND ONE OF THE COMMUNITIES MOST IMPACTED BY DISPLACEMENT THAT<br>
<br>
MARIA ALSO PLAYS A CRITICAL ROLE IN HELPING THE CITY MEET<br>
<br>
ITS STATE MANDATED HOUSING ELEMENT GOALS INCLUDING THE<br>
<br>
REQUIREMENT TO BUILD MORE AFFORDABLE HOUSING IN THE NEIGHBORHOODS WELL-SERVED BY PUBLIC TRANSIT.<br>
<br>
>> ONLY A FEW STEPS FROM BOARD AND KEY MUNI LINES IT OFFERS<br>
<br>
FAMILY DIRECT ACCESS TO SCHOOLS, JOBS, HEALTH CARE<br>
<br>
AND OPPORTUNITIES. THIS PROJECT PROVIDES HOUSING<br>
<br>
STABILITY ADDRESSES HOMELESSNESS AND ENSURES THAT<br>
<br>
LONG TIME RESIDENTS AND THOSE WITH GREATEST NEED CAN REMAIN<br>
<br>
IN THIS CITY THAT THEY HELP SUSTAIN.<br>
<br>
>> THE MERAVIGLIA IS EXACTLY THE KIND OF TRANSIT ACCESSIBLE<br>
<br>
COMMUNITY ROOTED AND EQUITY DRIVEN DEVELOPMENT AND THAT SAN<br>
<br>
FRANCISCO MUST PRIORITIZE AT A TIME WHEN HOUSING INSECURITY<br>
<br>
CONTINUES TO DISPLACE FAMILIES. WE URGE YOUR SUPPORT TO COME TO<br>
<br>
MOVE LA MERAVIGLIA FORWARD WITHOUT DELAY.<br>
<br>
>> THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. THANK YOU FOR YOUR YOUR<br>
<br>
COMMENTS. I'LL JUST MAKE A NOTE NO AUDIBLE SOUNDS OF APPROVAL IF YOU ARE IN SUPPORT JUST WAVE<br>
<br>
YOUR HANDS IS SUCH THAT THAT IS AN APPROVED BOARDROOM, RIGHT?<br>
<br>
>> MR. PRESIDENT. THANK YOU, MADAM CLERK.<br>
<br>
DO WE HAVE ANY COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS FOR THE PROJECT<br>
<br>
SPONSOR? >> SUPERVISOR MELGAR THANK YOU.<br>
<br>
>> I JUST WANTED TO HEAR AND I DIDN'T HEAR IT OF THE<br>
<br>
PRESENTATION WHY THERE IS A NEED FOR A SUBDIVISION OF THE<br>
<br>
LOT. >> WHY IT'S COME BACK UP.<br>
<br>
>> GOOD AFTERNOON SUPERVISORS KEVIN KETCHUM DIRECTOR OF<br>
<br>
HOUSING DEVELOPMENT AT MISSION HOUSING.<br>
<br>
IN ORDER TO FACILITATE THE TAX CREDIT FINANCE FOR EACH OF THESE PARCELS THEY HAVE TO BE INDIVIDUALLY PARCELS.<br>
<br>
ALSO TO GET A PERMIT FOR EACH OF THE BUILDINGS YOU WOULD HAVE<br>
<br>
TO BE ON ONE PARCEL FOR EACH BUILDING.<br>
<br>
>> THAT'S A REALLY TECHNICAL ANSWER.<br>
<br>
CAN YOU JUST SAY IT AND LAY LAY TERMS?<br>
<br>
YEAH, THREE DIFFERENT BUILDINGS IN ORDER TO QUALIFY FOR THE FINANCING YOU NEED THEM TO BE THREE SEPARATE.<br>
<br>
BUT WHAT'S DIFFERENT ABOUT THE BUILDINGS THAT THEY'RE INDIVIDUALLY FINANCING DIFFERENT?<br>
<br>
>> YEAH, THEY'LL BE INDIVIDUALLY OWNED BY SEPARATE LLC. SO YOU'VE WORKED AT MAYOR'S<br>
<br>
OFFICE OF HOUSING FOR YEARS WHO HAVE AS YOU REMEMBER SOME OF THESE SETUPS. SO WE HAVE TWO. WE HAVE TO FINANCE THEM INDIVIDUALLY AND THEY HAVE TO HAVE THEIR PERMITS INDIVIDUALLY .<br>
<br>
>> BUT WHY WHAT WHY ARE THEY DIFFERENT? THAT MIGHT BE A QUESTION FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AS TO<br>
<br>
WHY THEY AFFECT THEIR TAX CREDIT FINANCE THAT WAY. DOES MO HAVE ANY BACKUP ON THAT?<br>
<br>
>> THAT'S ALL I HAVE, MR. MOSS. CAN YOU JUST ANSWER THE<br>
<br>
QUESTION? >> WHY ARE THEY DIFFERENT BUILDINGS? WHY ARE WE NEED THE<br>
<br>
SUBDIVISION? >> WELL, THERE ARE THERE ARE<br>
<br>
THREE DIFFERENT BUILDINGS AND THREE DIFFERENT PLACES ONE ON 16TH STREET, ONE ON MISSION STREET AND ONE ON CASS STREET.<br>
<br>
>> THEY'LL ALL HAVE THREE DIFFERENT ADDRESSES.<br>
<br>
YOU KNOW THEY'RE SERVING DIFFERENT POPULATIONS THAT ONE WILL BE PERMANENTLY SUPPORTIVE HOUSING AS DISCUSSED AND THE<br>
<br>
OTHER TWO WILL BE FOR SENIORS AND FAMILIES MOSTLY FAMILIES.<br>
<br>
>> OKAY. THANK YOU SO MUCH. NO PROBLEM. WHAT I WAS LOOKING FOR THANK YOU. >> THANK YOU, SUPERVISOR<br>
<br>
MILLER. DON'T GO BACK. I GOT WELL, MR. MOSS. >> I'LL BE YOU KNOW, I'LL BE<br>
<br>
HONEST. I THINK THIS WAS THIS IS SHOULD BE A PRETTY EASY APPEAL FOR YOU TO WIN.<br>
<br>
I THINK ON THE ON THE SIMPLE LEGAL QUESTION I THINK YOU KNOW<br>
<br>
THAT PROBABLY THERE'S THERE'S NOT A WHOLE LOT THE BOARD COULD<br>
<br>
DO IF THE BOARD WERE CONCERNED ABOUT THIS PROJECT TO STOP IT<br>
<br>
BASED ON A MAP A MAP APPEAL. BUT YOU DID GO FURTHER THAN<br>
<br>
MAKING THAT ARGUMENT AND YOU DISCUSSED THIS AS SORT OF AS A<br>
<br>
BATTLE BETWEEN PEOPLE OF PRIVILEGE WHO ARE OPPOSED TO<br>
<br>
AFFORDABLE HOUSING IN THEIR NEIGHBORHOOD AND PEOPLE WHO<br>
<br>
BELIEVE THAT AFFORDABLE HOUSING IS GOOD AND SHOULD BE IN THE<br>
<br>
NEIGHBORHOOD. >> AND I DON'T SEE IT THAT WAY<br>
<br>
NECESSARILY. >> I MEAN TO TO I DON'T THINK<br>
<br>
THIS IS WHERE SUPERVISOR MELGAR WAS GOING BUT BUT ALL THREE OF<br>
<br>
THESE BUILDINGS WILL BE AFFORDABLE. THEY WILL HAVE DIFFERENT FUNDING SOURCES AND THEY WILL<br>
<br>
BE SERVING THE NEEDS OF DIFFERENT POPULATIONS.<br>
<br>
>> NOW I DON'T KNOW THE YOU KNOW I KNOW A COUPLE OF THE<br>
<br>
APPELLANT'S I DON'T KNOW ALL OF THEM.<br>
<br>
I DON'T KNOW WHAT THEIR MOTIVATIONS ARE. MAYBE THEY HATE AFFORDABLE HOUSING. I SUSPECT THAT'S NOT THE CASE. >> I THINK THERE'S A CONCERN<br>
<br>
IN THE CITY RIGHT NOW AND I THINK WE SAW IT EARLIER IN THE<br>
<br>
CONVERSATION ABOUT GEOGRAPHIC OR GEOGRAPHIC EQUITY THE REAL<br>
<br>
LIFE LIVED EXPERIENCE OF PEOPLE IN NEIGHBORHOODS WHERE WHERE<br>
<br>
HOMELESS SERVICES ARE BEING PLACED IS THAT ALL THAT THE<br>
<br>
CITY PROMISES THAT THESE ARE GOING TO MAKE THINGS BETTER, THAT OFTEN THEY DON'T AND I'VE SEEN THAT SOME IN MY DISTRICT I<br>
<br>
THINK WE'VE SEEN IT IN OTHER DISTRICTS AND I AM I ACTUALLY<br>
<br>
HAVE GREAT GRATITUDE AND RESPECT FOR MISSION HOUSING<br>
<br>
AND NOT JUST DID A SMALL SITE PROJECT AND IN MY DISTRICT<br>
<br>
THERE'S 12 PEOPLE WHO ARE ABLE TO LIVE IN THERE, YOU KNOW WHAT<br>
<br>
THEIR LONG TERM HOMES BECAUSE BECAUSE OF THE WORK YOU'RE DOING THERE I HEAR GOOD THINGS ABOUT MISSION HOUSING AND THEIR<br>
<br>
OPERATIONS AND YOU KNOW, ALL THE TIME.<br>
<br>
BUT I AM A LITTLE I MEAN SINCE WE'RE ON THE POLICY QUESTION OF<br>
<br>
THIS WHEN I LOOK AT 16TH AND MISSION WHICH IS ONE OF THE<br>
<br>
MAYORS VERY TOP PRIORITIES IN TERMS OF AREAS THAT NEED TO<br>
<br>
GET CLEANED UP AND I HEAR THE REAL LIVE CONCERN FROM PEOPLE<br>
<br>
WHO SEE WHAT HAPPENS WHEN AND MIGHT NOT BE ALL HOMELESS<br>
<br>
FACILITIES BUT CERTAINLY SOME HOMELESS FACILITIES OR DRUG RELATED FACILITIES DO SEEM TO MAKE THINGS WORSE LIKE WITH<br>
<br>
WHAT CONFIDENCE AND WHY SHOULD THESE PEOPLE BELIEVE THAT THIS<br>
<br>
WILL BE ONE OF THOSE CASES WHERE THINGS DON'T GET WORSE?<br>
<br>
I MEAN ARE WE TALKING ABOUT THE THE ACTUAL APPEAL OR I MEAN I<br>
<br>
WOULD HAPPILY YOU KNOW, I, I LOOK I GUESS YOUR STATEMENT WAS<br>
<br>
ABOUT THE MOTIVATIONS. PEOPLE ARE WRONG. I CAN SAY WITH CONFIDENCE THAT THE SUPPORTIVE HOUSING INDUSTRY<br>
<br>
IS LEARNING AND GETTING BETTER THE BUDGET FOR OUR BUILDING<br>
<br>
WILL BE MUCH MORE WITH MUCH MORE WRAPAROUND SERVICES THAN<br>
<br>
EVER BEING BUILT. >> I WOULD ASK WHAT ELSE YOU<br>
<br>
WOULD HAVE US DO THAN HOUSE HOMELESS PEOPLE. I STAND BY MISSION HOUSING I STAND BY MISSION ECONOMIC<br>
<br>
DEVELOPMENT AGENCY MORE THAN ANYTHING I STAND BY THE DECADE<br>
<br>
AND THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE FROM THE MISSION WHO HAVE CALLED FOR<br>
<br>
THESE BUILDINGS AT THESE INCOME LEVELS WE MISSION HOUSING<br>
<br>
AND HEAT. >> I DO NOT PLAN ON MAKING<br>
<br>
ANYTHING WORSE. WE PLAN ON MAKING AS MUCH<br>
<br>
BETTER AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE. >> BUT I CAN'T YOU KNOW, I<br>
<br>
DON'T HAVE A ONE TO GO TO THE FUTURE TO PROVE IT.<br>
<br>
BUT YOU KNOW, WE'RE ALSO OPEN TO ANY SUPPORT THE CITY OF SAN<br>
<br>
FRANCISCO, DPW, THE POLICE DEPARTMENT, THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS WANT TO PROVIDE FOR THE CURRENT STATE OF THE<br>
<br>
STREETS BECAUSE THAT'S NOT PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING IS NOT. SUPERVISOR ONE THANK YOU.<br>
<br>
PRESIDENT I, I WASN'T GOING TO CHIME IN.<br>
<br>
I WAS GOING TO STICK TO THE INTENT OF THE HEARING.<br>
<br>
>> BUT SINCE WE'RE HAVING A GENERAL CONVERSATION NOW I DO<br>
<br>
JUST WANT TO SAY THAT THIS SITE HAS BEEN SOMETHING THAT<br>
<br>
COMMUNITY HAS BEEN FIGHTING FOR FOR SO MANY YEARS.<br>
<br>
I MEAN PRIOR TO MY ELECTION TO THE BOARD OF EDUCATION, PRIOR<br>
<br>
TO MY ELECTION TO THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS AND THERE WERE<br>
<br>
OTHER PROJECTS PROPOSED AT THIS SITE THAT COMMUNITY FOUGHT<br>
<br>
AGAINST AND MOST CERTAINLY THEY SHOULD HAVE.<br>
<br>
AND THEN COMMUNITY CAME TOGETHER TO GET A SITE WHERE<br>
<br>
WE'RE GOING TO SEE ALL AFFORDABLE HOUSING.<br>
<br>
>> TO ME THAT IS ONE OF THE MOST WONDERFUL THINGS THAT CAN<br>
<br>
HAPPEN IN THE CITY AND COUNTY OF SAN FRANCISCO IS TO GET A<br>
<br>
SITE THAT IS 100% AFFORDABLE, PARTICULARLY WHEN WE KNOW ALL<br>
<br>
OF THE PRIOR ISSUES AROUND THE DEVELOPER AND WHAT WAS GOING TO<br>
<br>
BE PROPOSED AT THIS SITE. I WENT AND HAD SEVERAL<br>
<br>
CONVERSATIONS. OBVIOUSLY IT'S A DIFFERENT SCHOOL COMMUNITY NOW BUT MOST CERTAINLY SPENT TIME WITH<br>
<br>
PARENTS AND FAMILIES AT MARSHALL AT THAT TIME.<br>
<br>
BUT THE REALITY OF IT IS WE NEED MORE AFFORDABLE HOUSING<br>
<br>
IN SAN FRANCISCO. WE NEED MORE PERMANENT<br>
<br>
SUPPORTIVE HOUSING IN SAN FRANCISCO.<br>
<br>
AND THERE ARE SEVERAL WAYS TO MITIGATE ALL CONCERNS THAT HAVE<br>
<br>
BEEN BROUGHT UP FROM THE SCHOOL COMMUNITY AS WELL AS ANY<br>
<br>
COMMUNITY. BUT I KNOW THAT THERE'S<br>
<br>
OVERWHELMING SUPPORT EXCUSE ME FOR THIS PROJECT.<br>
<br>
THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT.<br>
<br>
WITH THAT WE WILL GO TO PUBLIC COMMENT IN SUPPORT OF OF OF THE<br>
<br>
OPPOSITION TO THE APPEAL AND IN SUPPORT OF THE PROJECT.<br>
<br>
IF YOU WOULD LINE UP ON THE RIGHT HAND SIDE OF THE CHAMBER<br>
<br>
NEAR THE CURTAINS. LET'S HEAR FROM OUR FIRST SPEAKER. >> COME ON UP.<br>
<br>
>> WE'RE SETTING THE TIMER FOR TWO MINUTES.<br>
<br>
>> YES, PROCEED. HI THERE. MY NAME IS CONOR ALLEN, LONG TIME RESIDENT, FIRST TIME<br>
<br>
SPEAKER TO THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS.<br>
<br>
I'M HERE BECAUSE I WANT TO HIGHLIGHT THE COST OF<br>
<br>
BUREAUCRATIC DELAY. >> I'M BORN AND RAISED IN THE<br>
<br>
BAY AREA RESIDENT OF THE MISSION 16TH STREET AND BART IS<br>
<br>
MY BART STATION. AND WE DESERVE BETTER THAN AN<br>
<br>
ABANDONED WAL-MART. THE ALTERNATIVE TO BUILDING<br>
<br>
SOMETHING THAT'S GOING TO HOUSE PEOPLE AND SUPPORT PEOPLE IS AN<br>
<br>
EMPTY STOREFRONT AND AN EMPTY PARKING LOT THAT BECOMES A PLACE FOR THESE ISSUES TO GET WORSE.<br>
<br>
I DEEPLY CARE FOR THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE THEIR CHILDREN IN THE<br>
<br>
CITY. I HOPE TO BE SOMEONE WHO CAN LIVE IN THE CITY AND RAISE MY KIDS HERE.<br>
<br>
>> WE ARE GOING TO BE MORE CAPABLE OF MAKING THE CITY A<br>
<br>
SAFE PLACE OF HOUSING PEOPLE WITH A AFFORDABLE HOUSING<br>
<br>
DEVELOPMENT AT THIS LOCATION RATHER THAN AN EMPTY WALGREENS<br>
<br>
SORRY EMPTY WALGREENS THAT THE POLICE HAVE TO SORT OF SKIRT<br>
<br>
AROUND THE EDGES AND CONSTANTLY SWEEP UP AFTER SAN FRANCISCO<br>
<br>
NEEDS PEOPLE WHO LOVE IT. MISSION HOUSING IS A GROUP OF<br>
<br>
PEOPLE WHO LOVE THIS CITY AND LOVE MEANS A LOT MORE WITH<br>
<br>
ACTION AND BUILDING THE SUPPORTIVE HOUSING, BUILDING THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING THAT INCLUDES SUPPORT FOR FAMILIES<br>
<br>
IS THAT ACTION THAT WE NEED AND THE BUREAUCRATIC DELAY IS<br>
<br>
GOING TO CONTINUE THE PROCESS THAT WE HAVE SEEN WHICH IS THE<br>
<br>
DECAY OF THE STORY. >> THANK YOU.<br>
<br>
>> THANK YOU. NEXT SPEAKER.<br>
<br>
HELLO, MY NAME IS NICK ROETHLISBERGER. I LIVE IN THE MISSION AND I CAN'T THINK OF A REASON THAT<br>
<br>
YOU I MEAN THIS IS THE PERFECT PLACE.<br>
<br>
THERE'S 300 AFFORDABLE UNITS ON TOP OF A BART STATION IN THE<br>
<br>
HEART OF THE CITY. YOU KNOW, FOR YEARS PEOPLE HAVE<br>
<br>
COMPLAINED WELL, WE DON'T WANT MARKET RATE HOUSING. THIS IS 100% AFFORDABLE AND NOW THERE'S COMPLAINTS THAT IT WILL<br>
<br>
ATTRACT THE WRONG KIND OF PEOPLE.<br>
<br>
>> I CAN'T WAIT FOR THIS TO GET BUILT SO THAT MORE PEOPLE CAN<br>
<br>
LIVE IN MY NEIGHBORHOOD. THERE'S A LONG LINE OF PEOPLE<br>
<br>
AND I'LL STOP. IT'S RIDICULOUS.<br>
<br>
IT'S IT'S THE WEAPONIZATION OF PROCESS.<br>
<br>
>> THANK YOU FOR YOUR COMMENTS. NEXT SPEAKER HI.<br>
<br>
>> MY NAME IS RUTH FERGUSON AND I LIVE IN BERNAL HEIGHTS.<br>
<br>
>> I AM REALLY PROUD TO BE HERE WITH DINA NEIGHBORS FOR HOUSING<br>
<br>
TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF LA MARAVILLA WHICH WILL ADD OVER<br>
<br>
350 UNITS OF DESPERATELY NEEDED 100% AFFORDABLE HOUSING FOR OUR<br>
<br>
COMMUNITY. >> SAN FRANCISCANS HAVE STOOD<br>
<br>
LOUD AND PROUD IN OPPOSITION TO TRUMP'S FASCIST ICE RAIDS.<br>
<br>
>> WE'VE OPEN OUR HEARTS TO RESIDENTS FACING HOMELESSNESS<br>
<br>
AND ADDICTION AND WE CHAMPION OUR SAN FRANCISCO VALUES WITH COMPASSION AND SENSIBLE SOLUTIONS TO EVEN OUR GREATEST<br>
<br>
CHALLENGES. >> SO WHY WOULDN'T WE SUPPORT<br>
<br>
THIS CRITICALLY NEEDED AFFORDABLE HOUSING?<br>
<br>
WHY WOULDN'T WE STAND TOGETHER TO SUPPORT EVIDENCE BASED HOUSING FIRST SOLUTIONS FOR OUR NEIGHBORS WHEN WE NEED IT MOST<br>
<br>
? THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF TALK TODAY ABOUT THE IMPACT ON CHILDREN'S AND FAMILIES OF THIS<br>
<br>
SITE AS A PERUSE APPROVED. >> BUT WHAT ABOUT THE CHILDREN<br>
<br>
AND FAMILIES WHO WILL BENEFIT FROM THIS PROJECT? >> WHO WILL HAVE A ROOF OVER THEIR HEADS BECAUSE OF THIS<br>
<br>
PROJECT? >> I SYMPATHIZE WITH THE<br>
<br>
CHALLENGES FACED BY OUR MISSION NEIGHBORS. I REALLY DO AND I DON'T WANT TO MINIMIZE WHAT THEY'VE<br>
<br>
EXPERIENCED. I HEAR YOU WHEN YOU SAY WHEN<br>
<br>
YOU SHARE HOW TOUGH IT'S BEEN. >> TO BE CLEAR, I SUPPORT<br>
<br>
BUILDING THIS 100% AFFORDABLE HOUSING SITE IN THE MISSION.<br>
<br>
BUT I KNOW THAT WEALTHIER COMMUNITIES LIKE MY OWN<br>
<br>
IN BERNAL HEIGHTS NEED TO STEP UP AND WELCOME MORE AFFORDABLE HOUSING IN OUR OWN NEIGHBORHOOD.<br>
<br>
>> THAT'S WHY MY COLLEAGUES AND I DENY NEIGHBORS FOR HOUSING HAVE BEEN VOCAL IN ASKING THE CITY TO INCLUDE<br>
<br>
BERNAL HEIGHTS IN THE FAMILY ZONING PLAN SO WE CAN SEE MORE<br>
<br>
HOUSING LIKE LAMAR VILLA IN OUR OWN BACKYARD. >> WE MUST ADDRESS THE RACIST HISTORY OF EXCLUSIONARY ZONING<br>
<br>
AND SHARE IN THE HOUSING BURDEN FACED BY OUR NEIGHBORS IN THE<br>
<br>
MISSION. >> POVERTY AND HOMELESSNESS IS<br>
<br>
A POLICY FAILURE AND IT'S A POLICY CHOICE. I URGE ALL OF YOU TO DENY THIS APPEAL AND INSTEAD BUILD A<br>
<br>
FUTURE THAT CREATES OPPORTUNITY FOR ALL SAN FRANCISCANS.<br>
<br>
>> THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR YOUR COMMENTS.<br>
<br>
>> WELCOME TO THE NEXT SPEAKER .<br>
<br>
>> GOOD AFTERNOON SUPERVISORS. MY NAME IS BRANDON POWELL.<br>
<br>
I'M A MEMBER OF DISTRICT NINE NEIGHBORS FOR HOUSING.<br>
<br>
THE CONCERNS ABOUT STREET CONDITIONS THAT WERE HIGHLIGHTED IN THE APPEAL PERFECTLY VALID.<br>
<br>
IT IS APPALLING. IT'S AN INJUSTICE THAT THIS<br>
<br>
CITY ALLOWS NEIGHBORHOODS LIKE THE MISSION AND THE TENDERLOIN TO BEAR THE BRUNT OF THESE CONDITIONS THAT WOULD NEVER BE<br>
<br>
TOLERATED IN OTHER PARTS OF THE CITY.<br>
<br>
THAT'S NOT A REASON TO STOP HOUSING.<br>
<br>
THIS HOUSING WILL ADDRESS THOSE VERY CONDITIONS. IT MAY BE INCREMENTAL BUT IT IS STILL PROGRESS.<br>
<br>
I ENCOURAGE YOU I IMPLORE YOU I BEG YOU DON'T STOP THIS<br>
<br>
PROJECT. >> APPROVE THIS SUBDIVISION<br>
<br>
WHICH THE PROFESSIONALS IN CITY GOVERNMENT HAVE INDICATED IS<br>
<br>
COMPLETELY WARRANTED AND ALLOW THIS PROJECT TO PROCEED<br>
<br>
AND LET'S GET SOME MORE NEIGHBORS.<br>
<br>
LET'S TAKE CARE OF SOME PEOPLE WHO NEED HELP.<br>
<br>
>> PEOPLE WITH SUBSTANCE ABUSE ISSUES ARE NOT PARIAHS.<br>
<br>
THERE ARE NEIGHBORS. >> THERE ARE FAMILY. THERE ARE FRIENDS. >> SO THAT'S THAT'S NOT A<br>
<br>
PROBLEM THAT WE WOULD HOUSE MORE OF THESE PEOPLE.<br>
<br>
LET'S PROVIDE SOME HOUSING FOR SENIORS WHO DESPERATELY NEED IT<br>
<br>
FOR FAMILIES WHO DESPERATELY NEED THIS HOUSING.<br>
<br>
WE'VE GOT TO DO THIS. >> THANK YOU.<br>
<br>
THANK YOU FOR YOUR COMMENTS. WELCOME. THE NEXT SPEAKER. >> >> HELLO.<br>
<br>
MY NAME IS PHILLIP RAFFEL. I'M RESIDENT OF DISTRICT EIGHT<br>
<br>
VALLEY AND I COME OUT IN SUPPORT OF THIS PROJECT<br>
<br>
AND REJECT THE APPEAL. >> MUCH HAS BEEN SAID ABOUT<br>
<br>
PERMIT SUPPORT, SUPPORTIVE HOUSING AND THE RISK IT INVOLVES. >> I JUST BURIED MY FRIEND<br>
<br>
EARLIER THIS YEAR WHO OVERDOSED IN THAT IN DOWNTOWN SAN<br>
<br>
FRANCISCO. HE WOULD HAVE BENEFITED FROM<br>
<br>
PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING TO CLEAR AND IT MIGHT HAVE SAVED<br>
<br>
HIS LIFE. IT'S TOO LATE FOR HIM TO THE<br>
<br>
FAMILIES WHO ARE WHO ARE MENTIONING THEY FEAR FOR THEIR<br>
<br>
CHILDREN. >> I CAN UNDERSTAND I'M NOT NOT<br>
<br>
FAR FROM LA MARAVILLA I WAS NEARLY JUMPED TWO YEARS AGO<br>
<br>
AND WOULD HAVE BEEN BEATEN UP BY SEVERAL BY SEVERAL MEN HAD<br>
<br>
IT NOT BEEN FOR MY 100 POUND ROTTWEILER THAT I WAS WITH THAT<br>
<br>
DAY. I UNDERSTAND THE SAY THAT<br>
<br>
STREET SAFETY IS A CONCERN AND IT IS A VALID ONE BUT<br>
<br>
FURTHERMORE MORE MUCH HAS BEEN TALKED ABOUT IN HOUSING ABOUT<br>
<br>
HOW IT'S A GIFT TO DEVELOPERS. THIS IS A NONPROFIT DEVELOPER<br>
<br>
BUILDING 300 UNITS OF HOUSING FOR FAM FOUR FAMILIES INCLUDING<br>
<br>
CHILDREN WHO ARE WHO ARE WHO GO TO MARSHALL AND WOULD NEED THAT<br>
<br>
HOUSING. IT IS FAR BETTER TO BE HOUSED<br>
<br>
BUT HAVING TO DEAL WITH STREET SAFETY AND AND THEN TO BE<br>
<br>
UNHOUSED AND AT THE MERCY OF THE STREETS.<br>
<br>
>> I THINK THIS I THINK IF WE FAIL AT THIS MAGGARD COULD NOT<br>
<br>
HAVE CHARACTER TO THE INEFFECTIVENESS OF SAN FRANCISCO BETTER AND WE WOULD DESERVE IT.<br>
<br>
>> THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR YOUR COMMENTS. LET'S HEAR FROM OUR NEXT SPEAKER.<br>
<br>
HELLO. MY NAME IS KATE VOCAL. I AM A LONGTIME RESIDENT OF THE MISSION AND A MEMBER OF DINA<br>
<br>
NEIGHBORS FOR HOUSING AND I FULLY SUPPORT THIS PROJECT<br>
<br>
IN ITS TOTALITY AND I'M GOING TO TELL YOU WHY.<br>
<br>
I WAS A PROJECT ARCHITECT FOR SEVERAL OCCUPIED REHABS OF TENDERLOIN SORROWS BACK IN THE EARLY 2000S.<br>
<br>
SO I WAS WORKING DAY IN AND DAY OUT WITH EXACTLY THE KINDS OF<br>
<br>
PEOPLE WHO WOULD BE LIVING IN THE PCH IN THIS PROJECT.<br>
<br>
AND ONE DAY I WAS DOING A FINAL WALKTHROUGH OF UNIT AS A WOMAN<br>
<br>
WAS MOVING IN AND WE ALWAYS PUT LIKE A LITTLE SHELF IN THE<br>
<br>
KITCHENETTE. SHE BROUGHT ME OVER THERE TO SHOW ME HER MOM'S CHINA. >> AND SHE WAS SO PROUD TO BE<br>
<br>
ABLE TO AFTER CARRYING IT AROUND IN A BAG FOR I BELIEVE<br>
<br>
SIX YEARS TO BE ABLE TO PUT IT ON THIS LITTLE SHELF THIS<br>
<br>
LITTLE SHELF IN THIS LITTLE ROOM TRANSFORMED THIS WOMAN'S<br>
<br>
LIFE, TRANSFORMED IT. AND HERE WE ARE 20 YEARS LATER<br>
<br>
AND WE HAVE BARELY MADE A DENT IN TRYING TO GIVE THAT TRANSFORM EMOTIVE EXPERIENCE TO THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE IN OUR CITY<br>
<br>
. WE DECIDED IN THE MISSION EIGHT YEARS AGO THAT WE WANTED THIS TO BE 100% AFFORDABLE HOUSING.<br>
<br>
AND EVERY SINGLE DELAY COST LIVES.<br>
<br>
IT COSTS PEOPLE IN TRAUMA. IT COSTS OUR CITY VITALITY<br>
<br>
AND IT'S TIME TO NOT LET THIS PROCESS STOP THE THE PROGRESS.<br>
<br>
SO I URGE YOU ALL TO DENY THIS APPEAL AND LET'S GET THIS BUILT<br>
<br>
AND LET'S GET THESE HUNDREDS OF FAMILIES AND INDIVIDUALS<br>
<br>
IN NEED HOUSED IN THE MISSION. THANK YOU VERY MUCH.<br>
<br>
THANK YOU FOR YOUR COMMENTS. >> LET'S HEAR FROM OUR NEXT SPEAKER. >> HI, MY NAME IS CHARLIE<br>
<br>
ITALY. I'M A RESIDENT OF MISSION BAY.<br>
<br>
I JUST WANTED TO COME AND SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF THIS PROJECT.<br>
<br>
NUMBER ONE, IT JUST 300 HOMES IS A LARGE NUMBER I THINK ABOUT<br>
<br>
IT'S 300 HOUSEHOLDS OR OVER SORRY OVER 300 OVER 300<br>
<br>
HOUSEHOLDS THAT WOULD BE TRANSFORMED BY THIS IS PROBABLY<br>
<br>
ENOUGH TO FILL THIS ROOM MULTIPLE TIMES.<br>
<br>
AND SO I JUST I'M HERE SUPPORTING THIS TO THINK ABOUT<br>
<br>
ALL THE LIVES THAT COULD BE SUPPORTED BY THIS PROJECT. SECONDLY, WE KNOW WE HAVE TO BUILD A LARGE NUMBER A VERY,<br>
<br>
VERY LARGE NUMBER OF AFFORDABLE UNITS BASED ON THE HOUSING<br>
<br>
ELEMENT. AND EVERY EVERY SINGLE PROJECT<br>
<br>
THAT WE CAN DO REALLY COUNTS A LOT. >> LASTLY, I THINK THE WAY THAT WE'VE GOTTEN HERE FEELS A<br>
<br>
LITTLE BIT WRONG TO ME. >> THIS IS LIKE WE ARE GETTING<br>
<br>
HERE. WE'RE HAVING AN ENTIRE HEARING<br>
<br>
BASED ON A LEGAL TECHNICALITY AROUND PARCEL SUBDIVISION. AND YET THE MAJORITY OF THE THINGS WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HAVE<br>
<br>
NOTHING TO DO WITH THAT. TO ME THIS SETS A BIT OF A<br>
<br>
DANGEROUS PRECEDENT THAT ONLY THOSE WITH THE ACCESS TO FREE TIME AND LAWYERS CAN FIND THE LOOPHOLES TO BLOCK HOUSING.<br>
<br>
>> SO OVERALL I WOULD I WOULD URGE THE BOARD TO TO APPROVE<br>
<br>
THIS AND HELP TRANSFORM THE LIVES OF 300 OVER 300 HOUSEHOLDS. THANK YOU SO MUCH.<br>
<br>
>> THANK YOU FOR YOUR COMMENTS .<br>
<br>
>> JUST A REMINDER TO THOSE IN THE VERY BACK OF THE PUBLIC<br>
<br>
GALLERY NO AUDIBLE SOUNDS OF EITHER APPROVAL OR LACK OF<br>
<br>
SUPPORT. WELCOME.<br>
<br>
HI. >> I'M GOING TO BE TRANSLATING. OKAY. I'LL SET THE TIMER FOR FOUR<br>
<br>
MINUTES. YOU CAN SPEAK FOR TWO MINUTES<br>
<br>
AND THEN TRANSLATE FOR TWO MINUTES. >> OKAY<br>
<br>
. >> IS SHOWING UP IN SUPPORT OF THE CONSTRUCTION OF LA MARIA. SHE LIVES ON 18 AND MISSION<br>
<br>
AND SHE'S LOOKING FOR SHE WANTS TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE IS AN<br>
<br>
ENOUGH AND THAT SHE'S LOOKING FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING.<br>
<br>
>> SO THAT'S WHY SHE'S HERE. >> I THANK YOU FOR THE<br>
<br>
INTERPRETATION. THANK YOU SO MUCH.<br>
<br>
LET'S HEAR FROM OUR NEXT SPEAKER PLEASE.<br>
<br>
>> HI LAURA FOOT EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF YIMBY ACTION<br>
<br>
AND THIS PROJECT OBVIOUSLY HAS SPECIAL MEANING FOR A LOT OF<br>
<br>
US. >> I'VE BEEN DOING ADVOCACY FOR TEN YEARS AND WAS A SUPPORTER OF THE MARKET RATE HOUSING AT<br>
<br>
THE BEGINNING UNTIL MY NOW HUSBAND WAS LIKE SHUT UP LAURA<br>
<br>
. >> AND REALLY THE AMOUNT OF COMMUNITY BUILDING EDUCATE HAITIAN LEARNING THAT HAS COME<br>
<br>
OUT OF THE PROCESS OF THIS PROJECT IN PARTICULAR FOR THE<br>
<br>
PRO HOUSING MOVEMENT FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING ADVOCATES<br>
<br>
THERE IS NO PROJECT THAT IS MORE POPULAR OR MORE WELL<br>
<br>
DOCUMENTED AND HAS BROUGHT MORE PEOPLE TOGETHER IN SUPPORT OF<br>
<br>
AFFORDABLE HOUSING THAN THIS PROJECT. I THINK IT IS WITHOUT QUESTION SOMETHING THAT THIS SHOULD MOVE<br>
<br>
FORWARD AND THAT THE CITY SHOULD EMBRACE.<br>
<br>
IT BRINGS PEOPLE TOGETHER. CHIRAG WAS TELLING ME THAT HE<br>
<br>
WAS HAVING MIXED FEELINGS ABOUT A LETTER OF SUPPORT FROM SONIA STRAUSS SO I THINK THERE'S A LOT OF HUMOR TO BE HAD ABOUT<br>
<br>
THIS AS WELL AND I THINK THAT THERE'S A THERE'S AN ASPECT OF<br>
<br>
THIS THAT'S WELL THIS IS AN IMPORTANT BECAUSE WE HAVE THE<br>
<br>
VOTES BUT ACTUALLY PEOPLE ARE AFRAID OF SUPPORTIVE HOUSING.<br>
<br>
>> PEOPLE ARE AFRAID OF HOMELESS PEOPLE IN EVERY<br>
<br>
NEIGHBORHOOD. >> PEOPLE ARE AFRAID OF DRUG USERS. >> THEY'RE GOING TO BE AFRAID<br>
<br>
IN EVERY NEIGHBORHOOD AND THAT'S GOING TO CREATE CONCERNS IN EVERY NEIGHBORHOOD AND IT'S ACTUALLY<br>
<br>
UNDERSTANDABLE AND HUMAN AND IT'S SOMETHING THAT THIS<br>
<br>
BOARD HAS TO NAVIGATE AND BE RESILIENT TO BECAUSE YOU HAVE<br>
<br>
ALREADY DECIDED THAT PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING IS A KEY<br>
<br>
STRATEGY FOR ADDRESSING THE HOUSING SHORTAGE.<br>
<br>
>> AND SO YOU HAVE TO ADDRESS EVERY TIME THIS COMES UP HOW<br>
<br>
ARE YOU ACTUALLY GOING TO GET IT BUILT IN THE WEALTHIEST<br>
<br>
NEIGHBORHOODS? I'VE SPOKEN IN SUPPORT OF HOMELESS HOUSING IN MARIN. OKAY, IT GETS HARDER THAN THIS<br>
<br>
BUT IT'S GOING TO GET HARDER FOR YOU IN SAN FRANCISCO AS WE<br>
<br>
BUILD ON THE WEST SIDE, AS WE BUILD IN DISTRICTS THAT HAVE DONE VERY LITTLE TO NO PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING.<br>
<br>
THIS IS SUPPOSED TO BE THE EASY ONE AND WE'RE STILL HERE.<br>
<br>
>> SO WHAT ARE YOU GUYS GOING TO DO TO ENSURE THANK YOU LAURA<br>
<br>
FOR YOUR COMMENTS. OKAY.<br>
<br>
WELCOME TO THE NEXT SPEAKER. >> GOOD AFTERNOON SUPERVISORS.<br>
<br>
MY NAME IS I CAN SPEND YOUR I'M HERE SPEAKING ON BEHALF OF THE<br>
<br>
SAN FRANCISCO DEMOCRATIC PARTY WHICH PASSED A RESOLUTION<br>
<br>
IN MAY OF THIS YEAR CALLING ON SUPPORTING THE MAXIMUM<br>
<br>
AFFORDABLE HOUSING AT LA MORAVIA THE MARVEL IN THE<br>
<br>
MISSION AND AT THE TIME THE RESOLUTION THAT MY BODY BROUGHT<br>
<br>
FORWARD WAS ABOUT A DIFFERENT SET OF COMPLAINTS SOME OF WHICH<br>
<br>
WERE BROUGHT UP AN EARLIER PUBLIC COMMENT ABOUT THE<br>
<br>
SHADOWING. BUT THE THE NOTION AT THE TIME WAS THAT IT WAS MORE OR LESS CONCERNS WERE BEING RAISED<br>
<br>
IN THE PRESS BUT THAT THIS PROJECT BECAUSE OF STATE LAW THAT HAS BEEN DEBATED AND SETTLED AND LOCAL LAW THAT<br>
<br>
HAS BEEN DEBATED AND SETTLED AND HOUSING ELEMENT PROPOSALS<br>
<br>
AND DRAFTS MANY, MANY, MANY MEETINGS HAS BEEN DEBATED<br>
<br>
AND SETTLED. THE CITY IS SUPPOSED TO BE PRIORITIZING BUILDING SUPPORTIVE HOUSING BELOW MARKET<br>
<br>
RATE HOUSING FOR PEOPLE WHO CANNOT AFFORD THE MARKET RATES.<br>
<br>
WE HAVE TO BUILD A LOT MORE OF ALL HOUSING FOR SURE IN ORDER<br>
<br>
TO ADDRESS OUR HOUSING SHORTAGE. BUT THE SAN FRANCISCO DEMOCRATIC PARTY SUPPORTS<br>
<br>
BUILDING THE MAXIMUM AMOUNT OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING AT THIS<br>
<br>
PARTICULAR PLACE BECAUSE THE FAMILIES IN THE CITY NEED IT<br>
<br>
PEOPLE WHO HAVE NOWHERE TO GO NEED IT. AND I THINK THAT ONE OF THE PUBLIC COMMENTERS OR NOT THE<br>
<br>
PUBLIC COMMENTERS ONE OF THE PROJECT SPONSORS SPOKE EARLIER WHO SAID IF WE DON'T DO THIS, WHERE DO WE WHERE DO PEOPLE GO?<br>
<br>
WHAT IS OUR ACTUAL SOLUTION? PEOPLE WILL DETERIORATE AND DIE<br>
<br>
AND BE SUBJECT TO VIOLENCE AND BE SUBJECT TO OTHER THINGS<br>
<br>
ON THE STREET. IF WE DO NOT ADDRESS THESE<br>
<br>
CONDITIONS AND THE CITY SHOULD DO MORE TO ADDRESS ADDRESSING THOSE STREET CONDITIONS. BUT WE ALSO NEED TO MAKE SURE<br>
<br>
THAT WE ARE BUILDING PLACES FOR PEOPLE TO BE ABLE TO REBUILD<br>
<br>
THEIR LIVES AND TO LIVE THE BEST LIFE THAT THEY CAN LIVE.<br>
<br>
AND YOU CANNOT DO THAT IF YOU ARE LIVING ON THE STREETS. SO THE SAN FRANCISCO DEMOCRATIC PARTY URGES YOU TO DENY THIS<br>
<br>
SUBDIVISION APPEAL AND TO MAKE SURE THAT THIS PROJECT MOVES<br>
<br>
FORWARD. >> THANK YOU.<br>
<br>
>> THANK YOU FOR YOUR COMMENTS. LET'S HEAR FROM OUR NEXT SPEAKER. >> GOOD AFTERNOON SUPERVISORS.<br>
<br>
MY NAME IS ROBERT DRUCKMAN. I AM A VOLUNTEER LEAD WITH SAN<br>
<br>
FRANCISCO YIMBY I LIVE IN DISTRICT FIVE.<br>
<br>
WE STRONGLY SUPPORT THIS PROJECT. WE BELIEVE THE CITY SHOULD DO MORE TO CLEAR ADMINISTRATIVE<br>
<br>
OBSTACLES THAT PREVENT THE CREATION OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING.<br>
<br>
I WILL SAY THAT TWO WEEKS AGO I HAD NO IDEA THAT YOU COULD<br>
<br>
APPEAL THE SUBDIVISION MAP FOR ANY KIND OF PROJECT MUCH LESS<br>
<br>
AFFORDABLE HOUSING. PEOPLE WILL COME UP WITH ANY KIND OF REASON TO JUSTIFY THEIR APPEAL IN 2016.<br>
<br>
THEN SUPERVISOR SCOTT WIENER SPENT A LOT OF TIME TO PREVENT<br>
<br>
A CONDITIONAL USE AUTHORIZATION OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING.<br>
<br>
NOW MANY, MANY, MANY PROJECTS HAVE SKIPPED A CONDITIONAL USE<br>
<br>
APPEALS OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND MORE STATE LAWS HAVE GONE<br>
<br>
HAVE HAVE DONE A LOT TO STREAMLINE AFFORDABLE HOUSING IN SAN FRANCISCO. BUT MORE WORK IS NEEDED.<br>
<br>
ONE IMPORTANT LESSON FROM THIS HEARING SHOULD BE THAT APPEALS<br>
<br>
OF PROJECTS IS NOT COMMUNITY PLANNING A APPEALS OR VETO<br>
<br>
POINTS. IT IS AN INHERENTLY REACTIONARY<br>
<br>
PROCESS. THE BEST OUTCOME IS THAT THE CONTESTED PROJECT PROCEEDS AS PLANNED.<br>
<br>
THE FREQUENT ALTERNATIVE IS THAT THE PROJECT DIES AND IT IS<br>
<br>
WITH BITTER IRONY THAT I SAY THAT IN APPEAL OF A SUBDIVISION<br>
<br>
MAP IS COMMUNITY INPUT BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN IT'S CONSTRUCTIVE.<br>
<br>
CITY LEADERS IN THIS VERY ROOM HAVE MADE IT CLEAR THAT<br>
<br>
AFFORDABLE HOUSING IS A PRIORITY FOR THE CITY OF SAN<br>
<br>
FRANCISCO AND IF IT IS A PRIORITY THEN WE SHOULD DO WHAT<br>
<br>
WE HAVE SET OUT TO DO. WE SHOULD NOT SAY WELL WE<br>
<br>
SUPPORT AFFORDABLE HOUSING JUST NOT THIS ONE BECAUSE THAT IS<br>
<br>
HOW WE HAVE GOTTEN TO THIS CRISIS OVER 50 YEARS OF SAYING<br>
<br>
TIME AND TIME AGAIN WELL WE SUPPORT HOUSING JUST NOT THIS<br>
<br>
PROJECT. THERE'S A REASON WHY<br>
<br>
ADMINISTRATIVE PROCESSES DO NOT RESULT IN MORE AFFORDABLE<br>
<br>
HOUSING. >> PLEASE APPROVE THIS PROJECT. THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR YOUR COMMENTS.<br>
<br>
WELCOME TO THE NEXT SPEAKER. >> HI, I'M MARIO.<br>
<br>
I LIVE A BLOCK AWAY FROM THE PROJECT ON SOUTH VAN NESS.<br>
<br>
I JUST WANT TO SAY THAT I'M REALLY LOOKING FORWARD TO<br>
<br>
HAVING HUNDREDS OF NEW NEIGHBORS. >> PLEASE DENY THE APPEAL. THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR YOUR COMMENTS. >> WELCOME TO OUR NEXT SPEAKER<br>
<br>
. >> HELLO. MY NAME IS ELI HOLLERAN AND I'M HERE TO SPEAK AGAINST THE<br>
<br>
APPEAL OF THE 1979 MISSION PARCEL PARCEL APPROVAL.<br>
<br>
THIS APPEAL IS AN UNDEMOCRATIC ATTEMPT TO CIRCUMVENT<br>
<br>
CALIFORNIA HOUSING LAWS INTENDED TO ALLEVIATE SEVERE<br>
<br>
SHORTAGES OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING IN THE STATE.<br>
<br>
THE 1979 MISSION PROJECT HAS MET ALL STANDARDS SET OUT UNDER THE LAW FOR APPROVAL AND HAS IN FACT GONE ABOVE AND BEYOND<br>
<br>
LEGAL REQUIREMENTS IN SEVERAL CASES BY HOLDING MULTIPLE<br>
<br>
COMMUNITY MEETINGS IN THE MISSION TO GET OUR INPUT ABOUT<br>
<br>
SHADE AND HEIGHT. THIS APPEAL IS UNRELATED TO THE<br>
<br>
ACTUAL PARCEL MAP APPROVAL PROCESS AND ONLY RELATED TO THE<br>
<br>
FRUSTRATIONS OF SOME OF MY NEIGHBORS AND HAVING TO<br>
<br>
ACTUALLY SEE THE EFFECTS OF ANTI HOUSING ADVOCACY ON THEIR CITY AND ON THEIR UNHOUSED NEIGHBORS.<br>
<br>
I LIVE ONE BLOCK FROM THIS PROJECT AT 15TH AND SOUTH<br>
<br>
VENICE AND I TEACH AT HOOVER THAT'S A MIDDLE SCHOOL THAT<br>
<br>
RECEIVES STUDENTS FROM MOSCONI, THE OTHER CLOSE BY ELEMENTARY SCHOOL AND THEY ATTEND IN SUTTON.<br>
<br>
>> I WORK WITH STUDENTS FROM THE MISSION WHOSE FAMILIES ARE UNHOUSED OR UNSTABLE HOUSED EVERY DAY IN SAWYER.<br>
<br>
>> TO SAY YOU CARE ABOUT STUDENTS LIKE THIS AND THEN DO<br>
<br>
ANYTHING OTHER THAN WHOLE HEARTEDLY SUPPORT A PROJECT<br>
<br>
THAT WOULD HOUSE HUNDREDS OF LOW INCOME RESIDENTS THAT WOULD<br>
<br>
HOUSE AS OF USC STUDENTS THAT WOULD HOUSE FAMILIES IS A<br>
<br>
CONTRADICTION BEYOND RIDICULE. I AM ASHAMED AT THIS CLASS<br>
<br>
AND HOSTILE BEHAVIOR FROM SOME OF MY NEIGHBORS AND I URGE YOU<br>
<br>
TO RESPECT THE NORMS OF THE PARCEL APPROVAL PROCESS AND UPHOLD THE VALUES OF A JUST AND WELCOMING CITY.<br>
<br>
BY REJECTING THIS APPEAL AND UPHOLDING THE APPROVAL.<br>
<br>

CHRONIC HEALTH CONDITIONS I LIVE IN CRAM WASN'T HELPING<br>
<br>
THEIR HEALTH. >> MY DAUGHTER HAS ASTHMA AND MY SON HAS ONLY ECZEMA IN THIS IF THE HIGH COST OF<br>
<br>
HOUSING AND THE LACK OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING FOR FAMILIES<br>
<br>
TO LIVE CAMP CHILDREN THEY ROAM THE SPACE TO THEIR DAILY<br>

<br>
I LIVE IN 20 STATE HISTORY. >> IT HAS BEEN FOR ALL THESE<br>
<br>
YEARS AND WE WANT TO ADDRESS THOSE ISSUES.<br>
<br>
>> WE HAD TO BRING TOGETHER THE ORGANIZE AND DEMAND FROM THE<br>
<br>
CITY MORE SERVICES FOR PEOPLE THAT ARE IN DIFFICULT<br>
<br>
SITUATION. >> THIS IS THE FIRST THING I WAS DOING COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT FOR MOST OF THE PROJECTS IN THE<br>
<br>
MISSION. THIS IS THE FIRST TIME THAT I HEAR FROM COMMUNITY MEMBERS HERE TREATING HUMAN BEINGS LIKE<br>
<br>
NOTHING AND I THINK THAT WE DESERVE BETTER.<br>
<br>
WE DESERVE BETTER BECAUSE I, I, I WAS IN A COMMUNITY MEETING<br>
<br>
WHEN A WOMAN A LATINA MOTHER WAS TALKING WITH THE MARSHALL<br>
<br>
PARENTS TELLING THAT THANK YOU GOT ANOTHER JEW RELATIVES A SON<br>
<br>
HAS A PROBLEM WITH ADDICTION WE HAD TO TREAT PEOPLE WITH<br>
<br>
RESPECT AND BRING THEIR RESOURCES FOR THAT ONE OF THE<br>
<br>
BUILDINGS IS FOR THAT PEOPLE WHO HAS BEEN USED ON ISSUES<br>
<br>
THAT WE CAN SUPPORT THEM. THIS IS THE FIRST TIME THAT I<br>
<br>
SEE THIS TREATMENT TO PEOPLE AND THIS IS UNACCEPTABLE FOR<br>
<br>
SAN FRANCISCO. PLEASE DO THE RIGHT THING.<br>
<br>
AND FROM PLACES 16 WHEN WE WERE FIGHTING FOR AGAINST THE<br>
<br>
MONSTER WE MENTIONED THAT ONE BUILDING IT HAS TO BE FOR LOW<br>
<br>
VERY LOW INCOME PEOPLE LIVING IN THE ASSURANCE NOW IS ALLOWED<br>
<br>
TO LIVE WITHIN LIVING IN THEIRS ARE NOT NOW THEY ARE IN THE<br>
<br>
STREET. >> WE HAD TO ALLOW PEOPLE TO<br>
<br>
HAVE A BETTER CONDITION LIFE AND THEIR FAMILIES.<br>
<br>
THERE WERE KEYS HERE. SOME PEOPLE HAD TO LEAVE BUT<br>
<br>
THEY WERE REAL KEYS HERE ASKING FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING.<br>
<br>
>> THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR YOUR COMMENTS.<br>
<br>
WELCOME TO OUR NEXT SPEAKER. HELLO, IT'S ME AGAIN. MY NAME'S KRISTEN ACOSTA. >> I'M THE COMMUNITY PROGRAMS<br>
<br>
MANAGER AT THE WOMEN'S BUILDING .<br>
<br>
I'M ALSO A HOUSING ADVOCATE AND A RESIDENT OF THE MISSION DISTRICT AND I'M HERE IN DEFENSE OF THIS 100 100%<br>
<br>
AFFORDABLE HOUSING PROJECT WHICH LIVES OFF THE BACK OF A<br>
<br>
DECADE OF COMMUNITY ORGANIZING. MANY OF US KNOW THAT OUR<br>
<br>
COMMUNITIES FOUGHT REALLY HARD FOR LA MARAVILLA BECAUSE WE<br>
<br>
REALLY KNOW HOW URGENT AFFORDABLE HOUSING IS AS WELL AS SUPPORTIVE SERVICES. >> OUR COMMUNITY MAKES UP A<br>
<br>
REALLY WIDE RANGE OF INDIVIDUALS AND ALL OF THOSE<br>
<br>
INDIVIDUALS WHETHER THEY'RE JUST INDIVIDUALS OR FAMILIES<br>
<br>
THEY DESERVE THE RIGHT TO LIVE WITH DIGNITY AND SUPPORT AND WE NEED TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT NO HUMAN BEING IS DISPOSABLE AS<br>
<br>
OPPOSED TO A LOT OF THE THINGS WE ARE HEARING TODAY AND WITH<br>
<br>
THAT MANY OF THEM WOULD BENEFIT FROM THIS PROJECT AND MANY OF<br>
<br>
THESE PEOPLE HAVE FAMILIES WHO ARE WORKING TOWARDS A REALITY<br>
<br>
THAT ENABLES THEIR HOUSEHOLDS NOT ONLY TO SURVIVE BUT ALSO TO THRIVE HERE IN SAN FRANCISCO. WE SHOULD ALL BE COMING<br>
<br>
TOGETHER AS A COMMUNITY TO PRIORITIZE HOUSING AND NOT<br>
<br>
VILLAINIZE THOSE WHO NEED SUPPORT. SO WE MUST GO FORWARD WITH MAKING THE MAHDAVI A REALITY<br>
<br>
AND WE APPRECIATE YOUR SUPPORT .<br>
<br>
>> THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR YOUR COMMENTS,<br>
<br>
MR. PRESIDENT. >> ALL RIGHT.<br>
<br>
>> PUBLIC COMMENTS IN OPPOSITION TO THE APPEAL IS<br>
<br>
CLOSED AND NOW WE WILL HEAR FROM THE APPELLANT FOR A THREE<br>
<br>
MINUTE REBUTTAL OF UP TO THREE MINUTES WE WERE TOLD FIVE<br>
<br>
MINUTES REBUTTAL, FIVE MINUTES REBUTTAL, THREE MINUTES BUT<br>
<br>
WE'RE EMAILED FIVE MINUTES I'M SURE IT WAS THREE MINUTES.<br>
<br>
MR. SOLOMON MR. PRESIDENT, SUPERVISORS I'M MARK SOLOMON, A<br>
<br>
36 YEAR RESIDENT OF MARSHALL NEIGHBOR. I HELPED WRITE THE APPEAL. NONE OF US ARE ATTORNEYS.<br>
<br>
WE DON'T HAVE A BUDGET OR A STAFF. DANGER IS A LEGAL BASIS FOR GRANTING AN APPEAL ON A<br>
<br>
SUBDIVISION MAP PROJECT SPONSORS HAVE INTRODUCED NO EVIDENCE OF THE PROJECT AS PLANNED.<br>
<br>
PURSUANT TO THIS MAP, BONDING WILL NOT ENDANGER MARSHALL SO<br>
<br>
MANY WHITE MEMBERS FROM NOWHERE NEAR MARSHALL THAT HAVE NO SUCH FACILITIES NEAR THEM SPOKE IN THE FIRST PERSON ABOUT OUR<br>
<br>
NEIGHBORS PROJECTING THEIR PREJUDICES.<br>
<br>
OUR NEW NEIGHBORS LIVE AT LA PHENIX CASA AVANZA AND 17TH<br>
<br>
AND FOLSOM. OUR NEIGHBORHOOD NEEDS MORE HIGHER FUNCTIONING NEIGHBORS LIKE THAT.<br>
<br>
WHY DOES MR. MOSS INSIST ON IMPLYING CASTING AND BE PREJUDICED ONTO RESIDENTS ABOUT EVERYTHING EVERY TIME HE OPENS<br>
<br>
HIS MOUTH? MISSION HOUSING IS NOT<br>
<br>
MITIGATED ANY IMPACTS AT LOVE ENIX MISS CLARK SAID THEY HAD THE VOTES. HOW DOES SHE KNOW THAT WAS X<br>
<br>
PARTY VIOLATED HERE I'VE WORKED TO BETTER THE MARSHALL<br>
<br>
COMMUNITY WITH FORMER SUPERVISOR JANE KIM TO RECITE PARKING EGRESS FROM 1550 15TH STREET TO DIVERT CARS AWAY FROM<br>
<br>
MARSHALL AND WITH S.F. MTA ON THE HOME ZONE THAT CALM TRAFFIC<br>
<br>
AROUND SCHOOLS SUPERVISOR WALTON'S CONCERNS I WAS ONE OF<br>
<br>
THE FEW RESIDENTS IN THE NONPROFIT DOMINATED 16 THREE<br>
<br>
PLAZA COALITION THAT WORKED ON THIS STUFF TEN YEARS AGO.<br>
<br>
RIGHT? WE ADVOCATED FOR COMMUNITY BASED PLANNING TO BUILD AFFORDABLE HOUSING FOR FAMILIES<br>
<br>
AND TO CARE TO CALL THREATS TO CALL FOR SOLAR ACCESS AT<br>
<br>
MARSHALL. THAT'S ALL BEEN THROWN OUT THE WINDOW WITH THE SUBDIVISION THAT IS WRONG.<br>
<br>
I SUPPORT A SALES FORCE TOWER OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING FOR HOMELESS FAMILIES ON THAT PARCEL UNQUESTIONINGLY THAT'S<br>
<br>
WHAT WE NEED PROJECT SPONSORS HAVE NOT REACHED OUT TO ANY<br>
<br>
MARSHALL AREA RESIDENTS THEY CALL THEIR NONPROFIT CLERK TO<br>
<br>
RIG PUBLIC ENGAGEMENT. THEY'VE KEPT THEIR CARDS CLOSE TO THE VEST BECAUSE THEY KNOW THAT PERCEPTION IN PHASE ONE<br>
<br>
WITH A GENDER OPPOSITION. THE FIRST WE LEARN WAS AT THE MISSION CABINS COMMUNITY MEETING MEMBER MEETINGS SINCE<br>
<br>
MISSION CABINS WENT IN WHERE MISSION CABINS TOLD US WHAT WE'RE GOING TO GET. WE DIDN'T APPEAL BECAUSE IT WAS<br>
<br>
THE ONLY WAY FOR THE COMMUNITY TO BE HEARD.<br>
<br>
OUR CLAIMS THAT THE SUBDIVISION DOES INCREASE DANGEROUS. THE RISK IN MARSHALL HAS NOT BEEN ADDRESSED BY SPONSORS<br>
<br>
AND STANDS. WE LIVE THIS EVERY DAY MARSHALL<br>
<br>
FAMILY SUPPORT DENSE AFFORDABLE HOUSING ON THE PARCEL<br>
<br>
AND POSTED ON TOP OF THEIR KIDS SCHOOLS. YOUTH HAVE A RIGHT TO BE SAFE AROUND AND WALKING TO THEIR<br>
<br>
SCHOOLS AND YOUTH OF COLOR HAVE A RIGHT FOR THEIR CITY NOT TO<br>
<br>
DO A RACISM TO THEM THIS SENDS A MESSAGE TO KIDS OF COLOR THAT<br>
<br>
YOU ARE EXPENDABLE SECOND CLASS CITIZENS OF THE MARSHALL<br>
<br>
COMMUNITY IS ANTI NIMBY. WE'VE TAKEN IN OUR BACKYARD BUT MOST OF YOU WON'T EVER HAVE IN YOURS.<br>
<br>
WE'VE SEEN THE WORK WE'RE DEMANDING OF THE CITY NOT BLOW<br>
<br>
IT AGAIN AND FURTHER ENDANGER OUR NEIGHBORS. KIDS PROJECT SPONSORS ARE THE NIMBYS HERE WE ARE THE END<br>
<br>
BECAUSE WE WANT PERMANENT AFFORDABLE HOUSING FOR FAMILIES<br>
<br>
AS DENSE AS YOU CAN GET. WE CAN'T TRUST A SHAKY NONPROFIT BUDGETS TO FOLLOW THROUGH WITH SECURITY<br>
<br>
OBLIGATIONS. WHAT IF THEY LOSE FUNDING? WE'RE SCREWED. >> DEFENDERS CALL ON SUPES TO<br>
<br>
SUSTAIN THE APPEAL AND FORCE SPONSORS ON A COUNCIL A<br>
<br>
NONPROFIT ARTS CLASSIC IS TO WORK WITH THE COMMUNITY TO<br>
<br>
BUILD AFFORDABLE HOUSING FOR HOMELESS FAMILIES THAT POSES NO SUCH DANGERS. YOU'VE HEARD FROM THE<br>
<br>
ELEMENTARY SCHOOL PRINCIPAL. OKAY. FIRST DO NO MORE HARM THAN THE CITY HAS ALREADY DONE TO OUR<br>
<br>
NEIGHBORHOOD. WE NEED TO BUILD UP.<br>
<br>
WE DON'T NEED ANY MORE BURDEN. WE'VE TAKEN MORE THAN ANY OF YOUR NEIGHBORHOODS HAVE EVER TAKEN AND WE WANT TO SEE<br>
<br>
PERMANENT AFFORDABLE HOUSING FOR HOMELESS FAMILIES AS HIGH<br>
<br>
AS YOU CAN GO. >> THANK YOU VERY MUCH.<br>
<br>
AND MR. SOLOMON, WE'VE PRINTED OUT OUR COMMUNICATION AND WE'LL PROVIDE IT TO YOU IN JUST A MOMENT.<br>
<br>
>> ALL RIGHT. WITH THAT, THE PUBLIC HEARING<br>
<br>
HAS BEEN HELD AND IS NOW FILED AND AS PREVIOUSLY DISCUSSED,<br>
<br>
WE'RE NOW GOING TO CONSIDER WHETHER TO APPROVE OR<br>
<br>
CONDITIONALLY DISAPPROVE THE DECISION OF PUBLIC WORKS AND THE TENTATIVE PARCEL MAP. AND I SEE THREE COLLEAGUES<br>
<br>
IN THE QUEUE. SUPERVISOR DORSEY THANK YOU<br>
<br>
PRESIDENT MANDOLIN. >> SO THIS IS A RARE AND MAYBE<br>
<br>
EVEN UNIQUE LAND USE APPEAL IN THAT I AM STRONGLY<br>
<br>
SYMPATHETIC TO CONCERNS VOICED BY THE APPELLANTS BECAUSE THEIR<br>
<br>
CONCERNS ARE VERY SIMILAR TO CONCERNS I HEAR REGULARLY FROM<br>
<br>
THE RESIDENTS OF MY DISTRICT WHOSE HOMES AND BUSINESSES ARE<br>
<br>
ADJACENT TO PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING FACILITIES.<br>
<br>
>> I WILL SAY IN THIS LITTLE ARCANE PROCEEDING, YOU KNOW<br>
<br>
WE'RE HAVING A POLICY CONVERSATION NOW THAT MAYBE WE<br>
<br>
WEREN'T PLANNING ON HAVING AS PRESIDENT RANDLEMAN SAID.<br>
<br>
>> BUT I AM A LITTLE TROUBLED BY SOME OF THE CONFLATION<br>
<br>
BETWEEN THE POLICY CONVERSATION AROUND AFFORDABLE HOUSING WHICH<br>
<br>
I THINK EVERYONE SUPPORTS AND PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING WHICH I THINK HAS REAL PROBLEMS THAT WE AS<br>
<br>
POLICYMAKERS REALLY NEED TO DIG IN ON AND HELP TO SOLVE.<br>
<br>
AND THAT I WOULD ARGUE THAT WE IGNORE AT OUR PERIL VIRTUALLY<br>
<br>
ALL PCH FACILITIES IN THIS CITY EMBRACE DRUG TOLERANT POLICIES<br>
<br>
THAT ARE MANDATED BY CALIFORNIA'S IMPLEMENTATION OF<br>
<br>
HOUSING FIRST. THIS OFTEN COMES UP IN PUBLIC<br>
<br>
SETTINGS WITH THE RESIDENTS THAT I WORK WITH WHEN WE HAVE<br>
<br>
PCH FACILITIES IN SOUTH OF MARKET, THE THINGS THAT END UP<br>
<br>
ON SOCIAL MEDIA ARE PROVISIONS FROM THE HOUSING FIRST POLICY<br>
<br>
SAYING THAT TENANT SCREENING AND SELECTION PRACTICES PROMOTE<br>
<br>
ACCEPTING OUR CLEAN UP APPLICANTS REGARDLESS OF THEIR<br>
<br>
SOBRIETY OR USE OF SUBSTANCES THAT THE USE OF DRUGS IN AND OF<br>
<br>
ITSELF WITHOUT OTHER LEASE PROVISIONS IS NOT A REASON FOR<br>
<br>
EVICTION. THAT RECOGNIZES DRUG USE AS AN<br>
<br>
ADDICTION AS PART OF TENANTS LIVES WHERE TENANTS ARE ENGAGED<br>
<br>
IN NONJUDGMENTAL COMMUNICATION REGARDING THEIR ALCOHOL<br>
<br>
AND DRUG USE. SO THIS IS THE FEATURE AND THIS<br>
<br>
IS AND THIS IS THE THING THAT RESIDENTS ARE OBJECTING TO<br>
<br>
AND WHEN WE TELL THEM THAT THERE'S NOT GOING TO BE DRUG<br>
<br>
RELATED BAD BEHAVIOR, THEY KNOW THAT WE'RE NOT ACCURATE ABOUT<br>
<br>
THAT. I DON'T OPPOSE HOUSING FIRST.<br>
<br>
I DO WISH CALIFORNIA BACK IN 2016 HAD EMBRACED AN<br>
<br>
APPROACH TO HOUSING FIRST THAT THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION'S HUD<br>
<br>
HAD RECOMMENDED WHICH THAT THERE SHOULD BE RECOVERY<br>
<br>
INCLUSIVE. I APPLAUD THE WORK BEING DONE<br>
<br>
BY MY PREDECESSOR MATT HANEY, WHO WAS IN THE LEGISLATURE<br>
<br>
RIGHT NOW TRYING TO LEGALIZE FUNDING FOR DRUG FREE<br>
<br>
AND RECOVERY ORIENTED HOUSING OPTIONS WITHIN OUR HOUSING<br>
<br>
FIRST FRAMEWORK. BUT I DO THINK WE HAVE TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE FACT THAT PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING<br>
<br>
SITES IN OUR CITY ARE ROUTINELY AMONG THE MOST RESPONDED TO<br>
<br>
RESIDENTIAL ADDRESSES FOR 911 CALLS FOR SERVICE AND THAT'S<br>
<br>
ESPECIALLY TRUE FOR POLICE CALLS FOR SERVICE. AND THAT CAN BE SOMEWHAT EXASPERATING BECAUSE WHAT I<br>
<br>
HEAR FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF HOMELESSNESS AND SUPPORTIVE<br>
<br>
HOUSING AND WHAT I HEAR FROM OUR NONPROFIT PARTNERS IS THAT<br>
<br>
NO ONE HAS IT IN THEIR BUDGET TO PROVIDE SECURITY FOR SITES.<br>
<br>
AND AS A MEMBER OF THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS WHO HAS SOME<br>
<br>
RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE ENTIRE CITYWIDE BUDGET BUDGET THAT'S<br>
<br>
EXASPERATING TO HEAR BECAUSE THE CITY AND COUNTY OF SAN<br>
<br>
FRANCISCO IS PROVIDING SECURITY. WE'RE PROVIDING THE MOST INEFFICIENT AND EXPENSIVE<br>
<br>
SECURITY BECAUSE THE POLICE DEPARTMENT IS SHOWING UP AT<br>
<br>
THESE FACILITIES ONCE OR TWICE A DAY WHEN WE COULD BE HAVING<br>
<br>
MAYBE RETHINKING ABOUT HOW WE'RE FUNDING THESE SO THAT WE'RE AVOIDING THOSE PROBLEMS. OUR FAILURE TO DO SO IS WHY<br>
<br>
WE'RE LOSING THE CONFIDENCE OF SAN FRANCISCANS.<br>
<br>
>> ONE THING I THINK WE CAN ALL AGREE ON IS THAT AS A CITY WE<br>
<br>
SEEM TO BE ASKING PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING TO SOLVE<br>
<br>
PROBLEMS THAT PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING WAS NEVER<br>
<br>
INTENDED TO SOLVE. I HAD A HEARING LAST YEAR ON<br>
<br>
SECURITY ISSUES AROUND PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING<br>
<br>
INCLUDING ONE THAT WAS IN MISSION BAY IRONICALLY NEXT<br>
<br>
TO THE PUBLIC SAFETY BUILDING A BLOCK THAT ONE WOULD EXPECT TO<br>
<br>
BE THE SAFEST IN SAN FRANCISCO AND THERE THAT WAS ONE OF THE<br>
<br>
TOP CALLS FOR POLICE SERVICE AND THE CALLS ABOUT DRUG USE<br>
<br>
AND VIOLENCE AND NUISANCE BEHAVIOR WERE JUST OFF THE HOOK<br>
<br>
AND THERE WAS IN THAT HEARING A LOT OF TALK FROM NEIGHBORS<br>
<br>
AND ALSO RESIDENTS OF THE FACILITY TALKING ABOUT THE FACT<br>
<br>
THAT THERE WAS A WOMAN WHO SPENT ALL NIGHT SCREAMING<br>
<br>
AND NOBODY COULD GET ANY SLEEP. >> AND AFTER THAT HEARING I WAS<br>
<br>
HAUNTED THAT YES, WE HAVE RESIDENTS ACROSS THE STREET WHO ARE OBJECTING TO THE NOISE FROM THE WOMAN SCREAMING AND YES,<br>
<br>
THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO ARE IN THAT PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING FACILITY WHO ARE UPSET BECAUSE THERE'S A WOMAN<br>
<br>
SCREAMING. BUT I'M ALSO HAUNTED BY THE FACT THAT I HAVE HAD A CONSTITUENT WHO SPENT THE NIGHT<br>
<br>
SCREAMING AND WHAT ARE WE DOING FOR HER AND WHAT WE OWE THE<br>
<br>
KIND OF LEVEL OF CARE THAT WE OWE HER AND WHAT WE GAVE HER<br>
<br>
INSTEAD WAS A LEASE AND A KEY. WE I THINK WE FINALLY GOT THAT<br>
<br>
PERSON THE LEVEL OF CARE THAT SHE NEEDED. BUT THAT IS SOMETHING ELSE THAT I THINK WE AS POLICYMAKERS NEED<br>
<br>
TO HAVE SERIOUS CONVERSATIONS ABOUT.<br>
<br>
>> TWO WEEKENDS AGO I HAD I HAD TO CALL 911 MYSELF FOR A<br>
<br>
NEIGHBOR OF MINE WHOSE MY DOG IS FRIENDS WITH HER DOG SHE<br>
<br>
DOESN'T HAVE A PHONE. SHE LIVES IN A PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING FACILITY. SHE'S BEING THREATENED BY<br>
<br>
SOMEBODY THERE AS SOMEBODY WHO'S VERY OUT ABOUT BEING IN RECOVERY FROM ADDICTION MYSELF I HEAR FROM A LOT OF<br>
<br>
PEOPLE IN THE RECOVERY COMMUNITY WHO LIVE IN PERMANENT<br>
<br>
SUPPORTIVE HOUSING WHO ARE BEGGING AND PLEADING WITH ME TO<br>
<br>
DO EVERYTHING I CAN TO FIGHT FOR DRUG FREE AND RECOVERY HOUSING OPTIONS. I HAD ONE CONSTITUENT WHO EVEN<br>
<br>
SAID IF IT WEREN'T FOR THE FACT THAT HE HAD THE RESPONSIBILITY<br>
<br>
TO TAKE CARE OF A DOG HE WOULD RATHER BE ON THE STREET.<br>
<br>
>> IT WAS A MAD HOUSE WHERE HE WAS LIVING. SO I DO THINK THAT YOU KNOW, I ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THIS<br>
<br>
PARTICULAR PROJECT HAS ITS OWN HISTORY BUT I WOULD FEEL MUCH<br>
<br>
BETTER TO HEAR FROM NONPROFIT PARTNERS AND ANY CITY<br>
<br>
POLICYMAKER IS THAT WE HAVE A LOT OF WORK TO DO TO LISTEN TO<br>
<br>
OUR SIDES, TO HEAR ALL PERSPECTIVES AND TO ACKNOWLEDGE<br>
<br>
PROBLEMS WHERE THEY EXIST. AND I'M TROUBLED WHEN I HEAR<br>
<br>
PEOPLE SORT OF SHAMED AS PRIVILEGE NIMBYS WHEN I DON'T<br>
<br>
THINK THAT'S TRUE. >> ALL THAT BEING SAID, YOU<br>
<br>
KNOW THE BOARD'S LEGAL DUTY HERE IS TO ADDRESS WHAT IS AT<br>
<br>
ISSUE IN THIS APPEAL. THIS IS A TENTATIVE MAP UNDER<br>
<br>
THE PLANNING CODE A SUBDIVISION OF A PARCEL, A PARCEL I AGREE<br>
<br>
WITH THE PLANNING DEPARTMENT'S CONCLUSION THAT THE APPELLANT'S CONCERNS RELATE TO MATTERS THAT ARE OUTSIDE OF THE TENTATIVE<br>
<br>
MAP THAT'S UNDER APPEAL. I'LL BE SUPPORTING THE PROJECT<br>
<br>
OPPOSING THE APPEAL BASED ON THIS PROCEEDING BUT AS<br>
<br>
POLICYMAKERS BECAUSE THE POLICY CONVERSATION CAME UP, I THINK<br>
<br>
IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT THAT WE ALL RECOGNIZE THAT WE HAVE A<br>
<br>
LOT OF WORK TO DO IN THIS CITY TO GET PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE<br>
<br>
HOUSING. RIGHT. AND I HOPE THAT WE WILL CONSIDER THINGS THAT WE CAN DO<br>
<br>
TO EXPAND DRUG FREE AND RECOVERY INCLUSIVE OF<br>
<br>
OPTIONS IN OUR PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING PORTFOLIO.<br>
<br>
>> SUPERVISOR MELGAR THANK YOU PRESIDENT.<br>
<br>
>> I ALSO WILL BE SUPPORTING THE PROJECT IN VOTING AGAINST<br>
<br>
THE APPEAL. IT IS, YOU KNOW, FAIRLY<br>
<br>
STRAIGHTFORWARD IN TERMS OF THE TECHNICAL ASPECTS OF IT AND WE<br>
<br>
HEARD FROM THE DEVELOPER THAT IT IS NEEDED FOR THE PROJECT TO<br>
<br>
PROCEED WITH FINANCING BUT I WANTED TO ADDRESS A COUPLE OF<br>
<br>
THE ISSUES THAT HAVE BEEN BROUGHT UP MORE PHILOSOPHICALLY<br>
<br>
IN THIS CONVERSATION LIKE MY COLLEAGUE FROM DISTRICT SIX.<br>
<br>
>> SO ONE OF MY VERY FIRST JOBS IN SAN FRANCISCO WAS WORKING<br>
<br>
FOR AN ORGANIZATION CALLED THE IRISH CENTER THAT PROVIDED PERINATAL ALL SUPPORT TO WOMEN WHO USE DRUGS OUTRIGHT.<br>
<br>
THERE ARE BETWEEN 14TH AND 17TH AND YOU KNOW, ROUGHLY THAN<br>
<br>
VALENCIA AND CAPP STREET AND AT THE TIME WE WERE STILL YOU<br>
<br>
KNOW, IN THE DAYS OF AIDS TRANSMISSION IN MY JOB WAS TO<br>
<br>
HAND OUT CONDOMS AND BLEACH TO THE LADIES WHO WORKED IN THE<br>
<br>
SORROWS ON MISSION STREET AND THIS WAS A POPULATION THAT<br>
<br>
WAS THEN ON THE STREETS 30 YEARS AGO AND IT'S STILL THERE<br>
<br>
NOW. >> SO I DON'T THINK IT IS<br>
<br>
CORRECT TO SAY THAT THE MISSION CABINS OR LE PHENIX OR ANY OF<br>
<br>
THESE NEW ACTIVITIES HAVE, YOU KNOW, BROUGHT THIS POPULATION<br>
<br>
BECAUSE I CAN TELL YOU THIS POPULATION WAS ALWAYS THERE<br>
<br>
AND NO, IT HAS NOT INCREASED. THE DRUG OF CHOICE IS<br>
<br>
DIFFERENT. BACK THEN IT WAS HEROIN A<br>
<br>
DECADE BEFORE THAT IT WAS CRACK. TODAY IT'S FENTANYL. BUT I YOU KNOW TO TO YOUR POINT<br>
<br>
AT SUPERVISOR DORSEY, I DO THINK WE HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY<br>
<br>
TO LOOK AT HOW WE'RE SPENDING OUR DOLLARS TO SEE WHETHER WHAT<br>
<br>
WE ARE SPENDING ON WORKS AND IF IT DOESN'T WORK TO ADJUST THE<br>
<br>
MODEL BUT I CAN TELL YOU THAT 30 YEARS AGO WHEN MOST OF THESE<br>
<br>
FOLKS WERE LIVING IN SRO THAT ARE PRIVATELY OWNED WITH NO<br>
<br>
SERVICES THAT DIDN'T WORK EITHER.<br>
<br>
SO YOU KNOW, I, I THINK THAT YOU KNOW, WE HAVE SPENT A LOT<br>
<br>
OF TIME TALKING ABOUT GETTING PEOPLE OFF THE STREETS, GETTING<br>
<br>
SUPPORTS AROUND THEM. >> I DO BELIEVE THAT PERMANENT<br>
<br>
SUPPORTIVE HOUSING IS PART OF THAT ANSWER.<br>
<br>
I DON'T THINK IT'S THE WHOLE ANSWER. I DON'T THINK IT'S A MODEL THAT WORKS PERFECTLY.<br>
<br>
I THINK THAT THERE'S AN EVOLUTION THAT NEEDS TO HAPPEN<br>
<br>
IN LIFE THAT WE CAN DO. BUT ONE THING I'M SURE OF IS<br>
<br>
THAT IT'S UNACCEPTABLE TO HAVE PEOPLE LIVING ON THE STREETS<br>
<br>
DECAYING TO THEIR DEATH USING AND NOT PROVIDING THEM<br>
<br>
SERVICES. SO THIS PROJECT WILL BUILD A<br>
<br>
HOUSING FOR FOLKS WHO HAVE STRUGGLED WITH DRUG ADDICTION<br>
<br>
AND ALSO FOR SENIORS AND ALSO FOR FAMILIES WHICH WE<br>
<br>
DESPERATELY NEED. SO I ALSO WAS ON THE PLANNING<br>
<br>
COMMISSION AND WHEN WE HELD THE HEARING ON THE PROJECT THAT DID<br>
<br>
NOT GO FORWARD THAT WAS PROPOSED BY MAXIMUS WE HELD A<br>
<br>
HUGE HEARING AT MISSION HIGH SCHOOL WHEN WHERE HUNDREDS OF<br>
<br>
COMMUNITY MEMBERS YOU KNOW, LATINO COMMUNITY, CHINESE<br>
<br>
COMMUNITY FOR THE YIMBY'S EVERYONE CAME OUT AND TALKED<br>
<br>
ABOUT HOW WHAT WE NEEDED IN THE MISSION WAS DEEPLY AFFORDABLE<br>
<br>
HOUSING. SO THERE WERE PROTESTS THAT THE<br>
<br>
CASE 16 COALITION THIS WAS YOU KNOW ALMOST A DECADE OF WORK OF<br>
<br>
COMMUNITY ORGANIZING TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAD AFFORDABLE<br>
<br>
HOUSING AT THIS CORNER AND I AM PROUD TO SUPPORT IT NOT TO<br>
<br>
MINIMIZE THIS AT THE ISSUES MARSHALL ELEMENTARY SCHOOL HAS<br>
<br>
BEEN IN THIS SPOT NOT IN THE SAME BUILDING IN THIS SPOT FOR<br>
<br>
100 YEARS IN THE CONDITIONS ON THE STREET ARE UNACCEPTABLE.<br>
<br>
I DON'T THINK IT'S DUE TO AFFORDABLE HOUSING.<br>
<br>
I DON'T EVEN THINK IT'S DUE TO PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING.<br>
<br>
I THINK IT IS A FAILURE OF OUR CITY GOVERNMENT TO PROVIDE<br>
<br>
SECURITY SERVICES FOR THIS COMMUNITY AND TO PROVIDE<br>
<br>
HOUSING AND SERVICES THAT ARE TARGETED AND ADEQUATE.<br>
<br>
BUT I THINK THAT HOUSING IS ACTUALLY PART OF THE SOLUTION<br>
<br>
AND I'M PROUD TO DENY THE APPEAL. >> THANK YOU, SUPERVISOR WALTON THANK YOU PRESIDENT MET AND I<br>
<br>
JUST WANT TO SAY AS WE LOOK AT THE APPEAL ITSELF, I BELIEVE<br>
<br>
THAT PLANNING AND DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC WORKS HAVE GIVEN THE<br>
<br>
APPROPRIATE RESPONSE IN TERMS OF WHAT IS ALLOWABLE BY CODE<br>
<br>
HERE IN SAN FRANCISCO. BUT WHAT I WAS GOING TO SAY<br>
<br>
BEFORE I INTERRUPTED MYSELF WAS THE ISSUES THAT HAVE BEEN<br>
<br>
RAISED HERE BY COMMUNITY ONE ARE NOT TO BE INVALIDATED<br>
<br>
IN OUR IMPORTANT BUT I ALSO THINK THAT THERE ARE WAYS TO<br>
<br>
MITIGATE THOSE CONCERNS AND THIS WOULD ACTUALLY NOT BE<br>
<br>
THE FIRST TIME WHERE WE HAVE SEEN A SITUATION WHERE WE'VE<br>
<br>
HAD PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING AND OTHER TYPES OF<br>
<br>
HOUSING QUITE FRANKLY THAT FOLKS DON'T NECESSARILY GET<br>
<br>
EXCITED ABOUT AND CLOSE PROXIMITY TO SCHOOLS, TO<br>
<br>
BUSINESSES AND TO OTHER RESIDENTS OR AREAS.<br>
<br>
BUT THIS PROJECT IS VERY IMPORTANT AND IF I GO BACK<br>
<br>
AND LOOK AT PROJECTS LIKE WHEN WE HAD CONVERSATIONS ABOUT<br>
<br>
BRINGING A STAY OVER SITE TO ONE TO VISIT THE HORACE MANN<br>
<br>
AND THE WORK THAT WE HAD TO DO WITH THE SCHOOL COMMUNITY WHEN<br>
<br>
I WAS ON THE BOARD OF EDUCATION THEN AND SUPERVISOR RONEN WAS<br>
<br>
IN OFFICE OR EVEN THE PROXIMITY OF THE SAFE PARKING SITE TO<br>
<br>
BRETT HART AND MY COMMUNITY WHERE WE HAD TO WORK ON HOW WE<br>
<br>
WOULD MITIGATE CONCERNS OF COMMUNITY SORT OF CONCERNS ARE<br>
<br>
VERY REAL BUT THE WORK THAT HAS GONE INTO GETTING TO THIS POINT<br>
<br>
AT THIS SITE IS ALSO VERY REAL AND IS SOMETHING THAT I ALSO<br>
<br>
CANNOT OVERLOOK AS WE HAVE A POLICY CONVERSATION AND I WOULD<br>
<br>
LOVE FOR ALL HOUSING TO BE 100% SUBSTANCE ABUSE FREE BUT THE<br>
<br>
REALITY OF IT IS WE CANNOT KEEP PEOPLE LIVING ON THE STREETS<br>
<br>
BECAUSE OF ADDICTION OR BECAUSE OF SOME OF THE THINGS THAT<br>
<br>
MIGHT AFFECT THEM NEGATIVELY. WE HAVE TO PROVIDE THE HOUSING<br>
<br>
I THINK THERE IS A BIGGER CONVERSATION TO YOUR POINT<br>
<br>
SUPERVISOR DORSEY BUT MOST CERTAINLY WE HAVE TO GET<br>
<br>
EXCITED ABOUT A PROJECT THAT IS GOING TO PROVIDE HOUSING FOR<br>
<br>
SENIORS THAT IS GOING TO PROVIDE HOUSING FOR FOR<br>
<br>
FAMILIES THAT IS GOING TO PROVIDE PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING AND GET FOLKS OFF THE STREET ALL THE SERVICES THAT<br>
<br>
NEED TO ACCOMPANY THAT. THAT'S IMPORTANT AND WE HAVE TO<br>
<br>
FIGHT TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT HAPPENS.<br>
<br>
MITIGATING THE CONCERNS THAT WERE EXPRESSED TODAY BY A<br>
<br>
SCHOOL COMMUNITY. ABSOLUTELY. WE HAVE TO COME UP WITH STRATEGIES TO MITIGATE THAT.<br>
<br>
BUT THIS IS AN IMPORTANT PROJECT FOR THE CITY.<br>
<br>
IT'S AN IMPORTANT PROJECT FOR THAT COMMUNITY AND I DO NOT<br>
<br>
LIVE IN A MISSION BUT I MOST CERTAINLY HAVE WORKED CLOSELY<br>
<br>
WITH A LOT OF LEADERS IN THAT COMMUNITY AROUND THIS<br>
<br>
PARTICULAR PROJECT FOR A VERY LONG TIME AND THIS IS SOMETHING<br>
<br>
THAT IS WELCOME AND IN COMMUNITY THE PEOPLE EXPRESSED<br>
<br>
CONCERNS MOST CERTAINLY THEY'RE VALID AND I THINK THAT A LOT OF<br>
<br>
THAT CAN BE MITIGATED AND OBVIOUSLY THERE ARE GOING TO BE MORE CONVERSATIONS ABOUT HOW TO COME TOGETHER, WHAT TO<br>
<br>
DO TO ADDRESS CONCERNS. BUT FROM A POLICY STANDPOINT<br>
<br>
THIS IS IMPORTANT HOUSING THAT THIS COMMUNITY HAS FOUGHT FOR<br>
<br>
FOR OVER A DECADE QUITE FRANKLY.<br>
<br>
BUT EVEN POLICY ASIDE AND MY PERSONAL FEELINGS ASIDE, IF WE<br>
<br>
TAKE THE HEAR ON THIS HEARING ON ITS MERITS, WE HAVE TO STAND<br>
<br>
BY IT PLANNING AND DPW. >> THANK YOU, MR. PRESIDENT.<br>
<br>
SUPERVISOR FIELDER THANKS, PRESIDENT ADELMAN THANK YOU,<br>
<br>
COLLEAGUES. I HAVE A LOT TO SAY SO EVERYONE<br>
<br>
BUCKLE UP. >> FIRST OFF, IT'S KIND OF A<br>
<br>
FULL CIRCLE MOMENT. I MYSELF WAS IN THE AUDIENCE AT<br>
<br>
MISSION HIGH SO MANY YEARS AGO IN SUPPORT OF THIS PROJECT<br>
<br>
AND THEN COMMISSIONER MELGAR, PRESIDENT OF THE COMMISSION WAS<br>
<br>
PRESIDING OVER THE TOWN HALL AND SO THIS IS INDEED A LONG,<br>
<br>
LONG JOURNEY THAT THAT BEGINS SO BEYOND THIS ROOM AND SO<br>
<br>
BEYOND THE PEOPLE IN THIS ROOM JUST FIRST OFF, THIS APPEAL IS<br>
<br>
NOT IN FACT AN APPEAL OF THE PROJECT ITSELF.<br>
<br>
IT'S A CHALLENGE TO A MINISTERIAL SUBDIVISION OF THE<br>
<br>
PARCEL MAP WHICH IS A PROCEDURAL STEP HANDLED BY THE<br>
<br>
DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC WORKS AND IS REQUIRED FOR THE PROJECT<br>
<br>
TO PROCEED. >> THIS IS NOT THE EXACT PROPER<br>
<br>
VENUE FOR OPPOSING THE PROJECT ITSELF.<br>
<br>
THE PLANNING DEPARTMENT REVIEW THIS APPLICATION IN COMPLIANCE WITH STATE HOUSING LAWS THAT REQUIRE CITIES TO APPROVE<br>
<br>
QUALIFYING AFFORDABLE HOUSING PROJECTS MINISTERIAL<br>
<br>
MINISTERIAL. IN SHORT, THE CITY FOLLOWED<br>
<br>
STATE LAW. >> LAMARR VILLA IS A 100%<br>
<br>
AFFORDABLE AND PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING DEVELOPMENT<br>
<br>
WITH DEEP ROOTS IN COMMUNITY ORGANIZING AND PUBLIC NEED THAT<br>
<br>
MEETS BOTH THE LETTER AND THE SPIRIT OF STATE LAW AND THE<br>
<br>
APPEALS CLAIMS ABOUT THE PROJECT ALL FALL UNDER THE<br>
<br>
PURVIEW OF PLANNING APPROVAL OF THE PROJECT NOT PUBLIC WORKS<br>
<br>
SUBDIVISION OF THE PARCEL MAP AND PLANNING CLEARLY DID THEIR<br>
<br>
DUE DILIGENCE AND COMPLIED WITH THE LAW IN APPROVING THIS<br>
<br>
PROJECT BUT HOLDING THE LAND USE MATTERS FOR ASIDE I WANT TO<br>
<br>
TAKE SOME TIME TO ADDRESS THE CONCERNS RAISED ABOUT PUBLIC<br>
<br>
SAFETY FULL STOP. >> IT'S NOT ACCEPTABLE FOR<br>
<br>
CHILDREN OR MARSHALL STUDENTS TO FEEL UNSAFE WALKING TO<br>
<br>
SCHOOL OR TO SEE PUBLIC DRUG USE OR BE SUBJECT TO VIOLENCE<br>
<br>
FROM DAY ONE MY OFFICE HAS BEEN ACTIVELY WORKING WITH CITY<br>
<br>
DEPARTMENTS TO IMPROVE SAFETY AND CONDITIONS AT 16 STREET<br>
<br>
AND THE SURROUNDING AREA. >> IT'S BEEN A TOP PRIORITY FOR<br>
<br>
ME NOT AN AFTERTHOUGHT. MY STAFF AND I, WE ALL LIVE<br>
<br>
IN THE MISSION. WE WALK THROUGH 16TH STREET<br>
<br>
EVERY DAY. >> WE MONITOR CONDITIONS AT THE<br>
<br>
BART PLAZA AND NEARBY BLOCKS. >> WE ARE CONSTANTLY ON THE<br>
<br>
PHONE WITH RESIDENTS SMALL BUSINESS AND COMMUNITY ORGS.<br>
<br>
>> ONE OF MY FIRST ACTS IN OFFICE WAS TAKING THE<br>
<br>
MAYOR ON A WALK DOWN 16TH STREET VOTING TO SUPPORT THE<br>
<br>
MAYOR'S FENTANYL EMERGENCY ORDINANCE AND ASK HIM TO<br>
<br>
UNFREEZE THE VENDING INSPECTORS THAT WERE CAUGHT IN IS HIRING<br>
<br>
FREEZE AND WE GOT THEM UNFROZEN.<br>
<br>
THEY'RE OUT THERE TODAY. I TOLD THE MAYOR I WOULDN'T BE<br>
<br>
SUPPORTING A RENEWAL OF THE FENTANYL EMERGENCY ORDINANCE IF<br>
<br>
IT DOESN'T BENEFIT THE MISSION AND IF CONDITIONS DETERIORATE<br>
<br>
REGARDING DISPLACEMENT WHICH IS WHAT I HEAR ABOUT ALMOST EVERY<br>
<br>
DAY I HEAR YOU. >> I'VE BEEN CONSISTENTLY<br>
<br>
BEATING THIS DRUM ABOUT THE CITY'S FAILED STRATEGY OF<br>
<br>
DISPLACING PEOPLE FROM NEIGHBORHOODS TO NEIGHBORHOOD<br>
<br>
AND BLOCK TO BLOCK. IT WAS THEN AS A PD COMMANDER<br>
<br>
LOU MONTHS AGO OUT OF COMMITTEE HEARING OPENLY ADMITTING THAT<br>
<br>
DISPLACEMENT IS PART OF SFP STRATEGY FOR MANAGING PUBLIC<br>
<br>
DRUG USE SUPERVISOR DORSEY IF YOU WANT TO TALK ABOUT<br>
<br>
INEFFICIENT SECURITY I SUBMITTED A LETTER OF INQUIRY<br>
<br>
TO S.F. PD TWO WEEKS AGO AND RECENTLY FOUND OUT FROM THE<br>
<br>
ANSWERS THAT S.F. PD AND THE SHERIFF'S HAS SPENT UPWARDS OF<br>
<br>
$350,000 OF OVERTIME RESPONDING TO ANTI ICE AND ANTI TRUMP<br>
<br>
PROTESTS. >> IT WAS THIS BOARD WITH<br>
<br>
MYSELF AND SUPERVISOR WALTON DISSENT THAT APPROVED $9<br>
<br>
MILLION IN OVERTIME WITHOUT ANY INSIGHT AT ALL INTO HOW<br>
<br>
OFFICERS ARE SPENDING THEIR OVERTIME HOURS.<br>
<br>
>> THAT'S WHY I CONTINUED TO HOLD AS A PD ACCOUNTABLE FOR<br>
<br>
CALLING OUT SICK THE SAME DAY THAT SOME OFFICERS ARE MOONLIGHTING AS PRIVATE SECURITY AND THE TEN BE RUN A<br>
<br>
COP PROGRAM AS OPINION SHERIFFS GOT MORE THAN $50 MILLION<br>
<br>
IN THIS BUDGET FOR OVERTIME AND WAGE INCREASE.<br>
<br>
SUPERVISOR DORSEY YOU SAID THE ORGANIZATIONS AND OPERATORS OF<br>
<br>
PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING DON'T HAVE ENOUGH FUNDING FOR<br>
<br>
SECURITY. >> WE DON'T EVEN GIVE THEM ENOUGH FUNDING TO PROVIDE LIVING WAGES FOR CASEWORKERS.<br>
<br>
MAYBE THEY WOULD HAVE FUNDING IF THE CITY GAVE JUST A SMIDGE<br>
<br>
OF THE HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS THAT GOES TO POLICE OVERTIME AND INVESTS IT IN AMBASSADORS AND ENGAGEMENT<br>
<br>
SPECIALISTS THAT ARE GOING TO BE OUTSIDE THESE PLACES.<br>
<br>
>> ASIDE FROM THAT, I'VE BEEN IN A FERVENT SEARCH IN MY FIRST<br>
<br>
SIX MONTHS IN OFFICE FOR LONG TERM SOLUTIONS THAT WORK.<br>
<br>
I CONVENED A HEARING CO-SPONSORED BY MEMBERS OF THIS BOARD VISOR MAHMUD'S VISOR, DORSEY'S VISOR, WALTON'S<br>
<br>
RESOLUTION ON THE FOUR PILLARS STRATEGY IN LIGHT OF INCREASED<br>
<br>
PUBLIC DRUG USE AND RISING RISING OVERDOSES IN THE MISSION<br>
<br>
. AND IN THIS HEARING I ASKED THIS AS A PD AGAIN WHAT IS THEIR PLAN TO MITIGATE<br>
<br>
DISPLACEMENT AND THEY COULDN'T PROVIDE AN ANSWER AND WHERE WE<br>
<br>
LEARNED THAT ZURICH, SWITZERLAND IN THE FACE OF A<br>
<br>
SIMILAR CRISIS DEPLOYING THE STRATEGIES OF HARM REDUCTION<br>
<br>
PREVENTION TREATMENT AND ENFORCEMENT TO DRAMATICALLY<br>
<br>
TRANSFORM THEIR CITY INTO ONE OF THE SAFEST CITIES IN THE<br>
<br>
WORLD. >> A SMART BALANCE STRATEGY IS<br>
<br>
RIGHT THERE. >> BUT SO FAR WHAT I'VE SEEN FROM OUR BUDGET DECISIONS IS THAT THE CITY CONTINUES TO BET<br>
<br>
THAT ENFORCEMENT ALONE AND THE ACCEPTED NATURAL DISPLACEMENT<br>
<br>
OF PEOPLE FROM NEIGHBORHOOD TO NEIGHBORHOOD IS WHAT'S GOING TO<br>
<br>
GET US OUT OF THIS MESS. IN MAY I HOSTED A TOWN HALL<br>
<br>
ALONGSIDE AS A PD BART THE NEW DEPARTMENT OF EMERGENCY<br>
<br>
MANAGEMENT NEIGHBORHOOD TEAM SPECIFICALLY TO GIVE THE<br>
<br>
COMMUNITY THE OPPORTUNITY TO SHARE CONCERNS ABOUT 16TH STREET AND THE SURROUNDING AREAS WHEN THAT SHOOTING<br>
<br>
HAPPENED OUTSIDE OF MARSHALL, MY OFFICE CONNECTED MARSHALL<br>
<br>
DIRECTLY WITH THE ASIAN MISSION STATION POLICE CAPTAIN TO<br>
<br>
ENSURE FAMILIES AND STUDENTS FELT SAFE COMING BACK TO SCHOOL<br>
<br>
. >> I'VE BEEN WORKING ON ADVANCING SUSTAINABLE LONG TERM SOLUTIONS INCLUDING MEANINGFUL<br>
<br>
VENDING REFORMS TO PROMOTE SAFETY AND A MORE STRATEGIC<br>
<br>
PUBLIC HEALTH RESPONSE TO THE DRUG CRISIS THAT PRODUCES REAL<br>
<br>
OUTCOMES AND DATA NOT HEADLINES AS IN THIS BUDGET I ADVOCATED<br>
<br>
FOR $2 MILLION TO BE ALLOCATED TO NON-POLICE COMMUNITY<br>
<br>
ENGAGEMENT SPECIALISTS TO SUPPLEMENT SECURITY ALL ALONG<br>
<br>
MISSION STREET FROM 24 TO SIXTH STREET 16TH AND WHILE WE DIDN'T<br>
<br>
GET ALL OF THAT 2 MILLION WE DIDN'T PRESERVE THE COMMUNICATION SPECIALISTS TO BE ABLE TO TRANSFER THEM TO WHERE<br>
<br>
THEY WERE AROUND 20 SECOND TO THE 16TH STREET AREA WHERE THEY<br>
<br>
ARE NOW ENSURING THAT CHILDREN AND THEIR FAMILIES CAN GET TO<br>
<br>
AND FROM PHENIX YOUTH ART EXCHANGE AND THE 16TH STREET<br>
<br>
CORRIDOR AND AGAIN I DON'T THINK THAT'S ENOUGH.<br>
<br>
MY STAFF AND I WE ALL HAVE LONG AND SHORT TERM GOALS FOR<br>
<br>
COMMUNITY SAFETY. OUR DRUG OVERDOSE CRISIS<br>
<br>
HOMELESSNESS AND AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND I TRULY BELIEVE<br>
<br>
THEY ARE ALL MUTUALLY REINFORCING.<br>
<br>
>> I ENVISION A 16TH STREET CORRIDOR WHERE CHILDREN CAN<br>
<br>
WALK SAFELY WITH THEIR FAMILIES TO MARSHALL TO YOUTH ART<br>
<br>
EXCHANGE TO BART AND TO HOME. >> I BELIEVE IN A 16TH STREET<br>
<br>
THAT CELEBRATES THE BEAUTY OF OUR AMERICAN INDIAN CULTURE DISTRICT AND OUR LATINO IMMIGRANT COMMUNITY WHERE WE<br>
<br>
HAVE TRANSIT ORIENTED AFFORDABLE HOUSING WHERE BART<br>
<br>
AND MUNI RIDERS FEEL SAFE AND DARE I SAY PLEASE TO TAKE<br>
<br>
PUBLIC TRANSIT AND WHERE SMALL BUSINESSES THRIVE.<br>
<br>
>> I WOULD SAY THE MAJORITY OF THE MISSION AND THE PUBLIC<br>
<br>
SERVANTS THE POLICE OFFICERS, PUBLIC HEALTH WORKERS, VENDING<br>
<br>
INSPECTORS, STREET OUTREACH WORKERS WHO WORK DAY IN AND DAY<br>
<br>
OUT ALL AROUND 16TH STREET SHARE THAT VISION TOO.<br>
<br>
I HAVE LONG BEEN A CHAMPION FOR LOW INCOME STUDENTS, FOR<br>
<br>
HOMELESS FAMILIES, FOR WORKING CLASS FAMILIES AND I WILL<br>
<br>
CONTINUE TO BE I MYSELF WAS RAISED BY A SINGLE MOM IN A LOW<br>
<br>
INCOME NEIGHBORHOOD. I LIVED IN A MULTIFAMILY<br>
<br>
HOUSING COMPLEX SURROUNDED BY GANG VIOLENCE.<br>
<br>
>> MY NEIGHBOR OWNED A LIQUOR STORE ACROSS THE STREET AND WAS<br>
<br>
MURDERED. >> I KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE TO<br>
<br>
GROW UP IN A DANGEROUS NEIGHBORHOOD AND I'M SYMPATHETIC TO THE CONCERNS ABOUT SAFETY FOR KIDS<br>
<br>
AND FAMILIES. BUT THIS IS NOT A LAND USE<br>
<br>
ISSUE. IT'S AN INVESTMENT ISSUE.<br>
<br>
>> 16TH STREET THE SURROUNDING AREA IS HOME TO PEOPLE OF ALL<br>
<br>
WALKS OF LIFE, ALL INCOMES. IT'S VIBRANT, IT'S MULTIRACIAL.<br>
<br>
IT'S A GEM. >> AND I ALSO WANT TO USE THIS<br>
<br>
OPPORTUNITY TO IMPLORE EVERYONE WHO WANTS TO SEE THIS PROJECT<br>
<br>
COME TO FRUITION TO CONTINUE TO JOIN ME AND THE FAMILIES OF THE<br>
<br>
MARSHALL STUDENTS AND THE CHILDREN LIVING THEIR LIVES<br>
<br>
IN THIS AREA TO CONTINUE ADVOCATING FOR REAL<br>

INVESTMENTS. THIS AREA DESERVES THIS BUDGET<br>
<br>
SEASON BUDGET CUTS EVISCERATED SAFETY PROGRAMS, SAFETY NET<br>
<br>

<br>
ABUNDANCE RIGHT NOW, ABUNDANCE FOR WHOM?<br>
<br>
>> ABUNDANCE FOR DOWNTOWN. ABUNDANCE FOR AIR COMPANIES,<br>
<br>
FOR MARKET RATE DEVELOPERS, ABUNDANCE FOR POLICE OVERTIME<br>
<br>
BUT NOT ABUNDANCE FOR 16TH STREET NOT ABUNDANCE GUIDED<br>
<br>

SO LET'S NOT MAKE THIS A ONE AND DONE DEAL.<br>
<br>
LET'S MAKE THIS A COLLECTIVE CALL TO ACTION.<br>

SUBJECT TO A REGULATORY AGREEMENT SUBJECTING ANY UNITS<br>
<br>
ON THE PROPERTY TO THE SAN FRANCISCO RESIDENTIAL RENT<br>
<br>
STABILIZATION AND ARBITRATION ORDINANCE AND TO REQUIRE THE<br>
<br>
PLANNING DEPARTMENT TO INSPECT PROPERTIES PRIOR TO<br>
<br>
RECOMMENDING APPROVAL OF ANY LOSS OF A RESIDENTIAL UNIT OR<br>
<br>
UNAUTHORIZED DWELLING UNIT TO AMEND THE BUILDING CODE TO<br>
<br>
EXPAND THE DEPARTMENT OF BUILDING INSPECTIONS EXPANDED COMPLIANCE CONTROL PROGRAM TO ADDRESS FRAUD, BRIBERY<br>
<br>
AND FAILURE TO ACCURATELY REPRESENT THE PRESENCE<br>
<br>
AND NUMBER OF UNAUTHORIZED DWELLING UNITS AT PROPERTIES<br>
<br>
SUBJECT TO A PERMIT APPLICATION TO AFFIRM THE SECOND<br>
<br>
DETERMINATION AND TO MAKE THE APPROPRIATE FINDINGS.<br>
<br>
>> SUPERVISOR MELGAR THANK YOU PRESIDENT MANDELA AND COLLEAGUES I JUST WANTED TO TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THIS<br>
<br>
LEGISLATION WHICH PASSED OUT OF THE LAND USE AND TRANSPORTATION<br>
<br>
COMMITTEE UNANIMOUSLY. IT WAS INSPIRED BY MY<br>
<br>
EXPERIENCE BOTH AS A BUILDING INSPECTION COMMISSIONER<br>
<br>
AND PLANNING COMMISSIONER THAT WE SAW OFTEN WHERE OWNERS<br>
<br>
APPLYING FOR PERMITS FOR RENOVATIONS IN THEIR HOMES LIE<br>
<br>
ABOUT HAVING UNAUTHORIZED DWELLING UNITS THAT WERE<br>
<br>
OCCUPIED BY TENANTS. >> AND THIS WAS AN ATTEMPT TO<br>
<br>
CIRCUMVENT OUR RENT CONTROL LAWS BECAUSE YOU TO USE<br>
<br>
UNAUTHORIZED DWELLING UNITS ARE RENT CONTROLLED.<br>
<br>
AND WE CALLED THESE RENOVICTIONS. AND AS YOU KNOW WITH THAT REZONING THAT IS COMING WITH SB<br>
<br>
330 AT DEVELOPERS MAY WANT TO ADD MORE UNITS EITHER THROUGH<br>
<br>
EXISTING EXPANSION OR DEMOLITIONS OF THEIR PROPERTY<br>
<br>
AND WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT TENANTS IN OTHER UNAUTHORIZED<br>
<br>
WELLING UNITS ARE AFFORDED THE SAME TENANT PROTECTIONS AS<br>
<br>
OTHER TENANTS. SO YOU KNOW THE EVICTION<br>
<br>
PROTECTIONS IN SB 330 APPLY ONLY TO ILLEGAL UNITS. THE TENANTS THAT LIVE IN UNITS THAT ARE UNITS NOT TO<br>
<br>
UNAUTHORIZED DWELLING UNITS. AND THIS IS AN ATTEMPT TO TRY<br>
<br>
TO BRING EVERYONE UNDER THE SAME PROTECTION.<br>
<br>
SO I DID SIT THROUGH SEVERAL HEARINGS BOTH IN BUILDING<br>
<br>
AND IN PLANNING OF TENANTS THAT WERE DISPLACED BECAUSE YOU<br>
<br>
KNOW, A LANDLORD WAS GOING TO JUST RENOVATE THE PROPERTY, GET<br>
<br>
THEM OUT FOR A LITTLE BIT WHILE RENOVATIONS WERE BEING MADE AND THEN LO AND BEHOLD THEY JUST LOST THEIR UNITS.<br>
<br>
SO THAT'S SOMETHING THAT NONE OF US WANT TO SUPPORT AND I<br>
<br>
HOPE FOR I THINK MY COLLEAGUES ON THE LADIES<br>
<br>
AND TRANSPORTATION COMMITTEE FOR SITTING THROUGH IT<br>
<br>
AND RECOMMENDING IT AND I ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT. THANK YOU. >> THANK YOU.<br>
<br>
BRIAN MELGAR. I THINK WE CAN TAKE THIS ITEM<br>
<br>
SAME HOUSE, SAME CALL WITHOUT OBJECTION THE ORDINANCES PASSED ON FIRST READING. MADAM CLERK PLEASE CALL ITEM 63<br>
<br>
. >> ITEM 63 WAS REFERRED WITHOUT RECOMMENDATION AS AMENDED WITH A NEW TITLE WHICH NOW READS AN<br>
<br>
ORDINANCE AMENDING THE PLANNING CODE TO ELIMINATE LIMITS ON<br>
<br>
NONRESIDENTIAL USE SIZES IN THE PACIFIC AVENUE NEIGHBORHOOD<br>
<br>
COMMERCIAL DISTRICT AND CD POLK STREET AND CD WEST PORTAL<br>
<br>
AVENUE IN CD NORTH BEACH AND CD AND NORTH BEACH SPECIAL USE<br>
<br>
DISTRICT REGIONAL COMMERCIAL DISTRICTS AND RESIDENTIAL COMMERCIAL DISTRICTS TO ALLOW SPECIFIED NONRESIDENTIAL USES<br>
<br>
THAT EXCEED THE USE SIZE LIMITS TO DIVIDE INTO SMALLER SPACES<br>
<br>
THAT MAY CONTINUE TO EXCEED THE USE SIZE LIMITS WITHOUT<br>
<br>
CONDITIONAL USE AUTHORIZATION TO ADJUST THE USE SIZE LIMIT<br>
<br>
IN ALL NCDS TO AROUND NUMBER TWO AFFIRMED THE SPEAKER<br>
<br>
DETERMINATION AND TO MAKE THE APPROPRIATE FINDINGS.<br>
<br>
>> CHAIRMAN LUGAR. THANK YOU PRESIDENT RANDLEMAN<br>
<br>
SO COLLEAGUES, WE HAD A ROBUST DISCUSSION ABOUT THIS AT<br>
<br>
LEGISLATION THAT I SPONSORED AT THE LADIES AND TRANSPORTATION COMMITTEE AND IT IS NOW IN FRONT OF YOU HAVING RECEIVED<br>
<br>
AT NO RECOMMENDATION OR PASS OUT OF A COMMITTEE WITHOUT A<br>
<br>
RECOMMENDATION TO YOU TODAY. AND I WANTED TO EXPLAIN A<br>
<br>
LITTLE BIT ABOUT WHERE THIS CAME FROM.<br>
<br>
>> SO THIS WAS A RESPONSE TO THE VASTLY AND RAPIDLY CHANGING<br>
<br>
LANDSCAPE OF RETAIL IN OUR CITY.<br>
<br>
>> IT'S REALLY A PHENOMENON THAT'S GOING ON ALL AROUND OUR<br>
<br>
COUNTRY IN OUR WORLD HOW PEOPLE BUY GOODS NOW AS OPPOSED TO<br>
<br>
THROUGH THE WAY THEY DID 30 YEARS AGO. SO WE HAVE SEEN AROUND THE CITY THE SHUTTERING OF WALGREENS<br>
<br>
AND CVS SAYS THERE ARE SOME FOLKS WHO WILL TALK ABOUT CRIME<br>
<br>
AND WHILE THAT IS REAL, THE REALITY IS THAT WHEN CAREMARK<br>
<br>
BRINGS YOU YOUR PRESCRIPTIONS TO YOUR HOUSE, THE INCENTIVE TO<br>
<br>
GO TO WALGREENS AND ALSO BUY TOILET PAPER WHILE YOU'RE<br>
<br>
PICKING UP A PRESCRIPTION HAS JUST BECOME LESS FREQUENT AND THAT IS HAPPENING NOT JUST WITH PHARMACIES.<br>
<br>
IT'S HAPPENING BECAUSE PEOPLE DON'T GO TO BANKS ANYMORE.<br>
<br>
THEY DO THEIR BANKING ELECTRONICALLY.<br>
<br>
SO WE HAVE HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF SQUARE FEET OF BANKING INSTITUTIONS THAT IS EMPTY.<br>
<br>
WE HAVE SEEN HOW BIG GROCERY STORES LIKE SAFEWAY HAVE<br>
<br>
REORGANIZED THEIR AISLES TO MAKE IT EASIER FOR, YOU KNOW,<br>
<br>
INSTACART DELIVERERS AND OTHERS TO COME AND PICK UP GROCERIES<br>
<br>
AND BRING THEM TO PEOPLE HOMES. WE HAVE SEEN A SEA CHANGE<br>
<br>
IN RETAIL BUT OUR LAND USE CONTROLS HAVE NOT REALLY<br>
<br>
ADAPTED. >> WE ARE LAGGING BEHIND THE<br>
<br>
INDUSTRY TRENDS SO THIS WAS A DIRECT RESPONSE TO THAT IN TRY<br>
<br>
TO MAKE THINGS A LITTLE MORE FLEXIBLE SO THAT WE CAN KEEP<br>
<br>
OUR COMMERCIAL CORRIDORS VIBRANT.<br>
<br>
>> SO IN THE LEGISLATION DOES TWO MAIN THINGS ONE IT GETS RID<br>
<br>
OF HARD CAPS AND PROHIBITIONS BEYOND A CERTAIN SIZE.<br>
<br>
THERE ARE ONLY THREE NEIGHBORHOOD COMMERCIAL CORRIDORS. I HAD THESE THAT WAS NORTH<br>
<br>
BEACH CASTRO AND WEST PORTAL WEST PORTAL HAD THE MOST<br>
<br>
STRINGENT AND IT IS A VERY SHORT DISTRICT ONLY THREE<br>
<br>
BLOCKS LONG BUT IT HAD A SQUARE CAP FOR THOUSAND SQUARE FEET<br>
<br>
THAT WAS AN IMPEDIMENT TWICE IN THE PAST COUPLE OF YEARS.<br>
<br>
ONE WHEN WE OPENED ALAN NATH ONE OF THE MOST SUCCESSFUL<br>
<br>
BUSINESSES ON WEST PORTAL BECAUSE THERE'S A 4000 SQUARE<br>
<br>
FOOT CAP THEY HAD TO DESIGN THE SPACE AFTER THEY MERGED IT FOR<br>
<br>
3998FT2. AND IF YOU'VE GONE TO L.A. AS YOU KNOW THAT THERE'S A LINE OUT THE DOOR ALWAYS SO THEY<br>
<br>
COULD USE THOSE EXTRA TWO SQUARE FEET FOR ANOTHER TABLE<br>
<br>
AND THEN THE SAME BLOCK AT THE CORNER THERE WAS AN OPTOMETRIST<br>
<br>
THAT ALSO MERGED TWO SPACES TO MAKE A NEW CLINIC AND I HAD TO<br>
<br>
DO SPOT ZONING, MAKE A SPECIAL LEGISLATION JUST FOR THAT<br>
<br>
IN THE PLANNING COMMISSION TOLD ME DON'T DO THIS HERE NOW THAT'S NOT GOOD PLANNING. >> YOU SHOULD HAVE RULES FOR<br>
<br>
EVERYONE. AND SO THAT'S WHERE THIS PART OF THE LEGISLATION CAME FROM. >> IT ALSO DOES THE OPPOSITE<br>
<br>
BIG SQUARE SPACE AND BIG BIG SQUARE FOOT SPACES LIKE WE HAVE<br>
<br>
ON OCEAN AVENUE IN MANY OF YOU DO HAVE THESE IN YOUR DISTRICTS<br>
<br>
THAT ARE EMPTY BECAUSE A CVS HAS LEFT THE WALGREENS HAVE<br>
<br>
LEFT AND IT'S REALLY HARD TO RE RENT THOSE TO HAVE SOMEBODY WHO<br>
<br>
CAN AFFORD TO PAY FOR ALL OF THAT SQUARE FOOTAGE AND TO<br>
<br>
SUBDIVIDE IT, IT'S REALLY, REALLY DIFFICULT AT THE PROCESS<br>
<br>
IS REALLY CUMBERSOME AND TIME CONSUMING. SO IT'S YOU KNOW THAT THOSE SPACES TEND TO SIT EMPTY FOR A<br>
<br>
LONG TIME. >> SO THIS LEGISLATION ALSO<br>
<br>
DOES THE OPPOSITE IN THAT IT ALLOWS FOR SUBDIVISION OF THOSE<br>
<br>
BIG SPACES SO THAT THE PROPERTY OWNERS CAN RENT THEM 2 TO 3 FOR<br>
<br>
BUSINESSES. HOWEVER THE THE MARKET WILL<br>
<br>
BEAR IN IT ALSO WILL ADVANTAGE SMALLER BUSINESSES TO BE ABLE<br>
<br>
TO AFFORD THAT THOSE SPACES ON COMMERCIAL CORRIDORS.<br>
<br>
>> SO THERE WAS A LOT OF QUESTIONS WE DID RECEIVE<br>
<br>
PUSHBACK FROM FOLKS IN NORTH BEACH. I DID CONSULT WITH DISTRICT THREE SUPERVISOR SAUDER WHO<br>
<br>
AGREED WITH THE LEGISLATION IS ACTUALLY ONE OF THE CO-SPONSORS<br>
<br>
AND PRESIDENT RANDLEMAN AGREED TO PART OF THE LEGISLATION BUT<br>
<br>
NOT ALL OF IT FOR THE CASTRO WHICH IS WHERE WE GOT TO TODAY.<br>
<br>
BUT I DO THINK COLLEAGUES THAT IN LOOKING FORWARD TO WHAT'S<br>
<br>
HAPPENING AROUND OUR CITY AND THE CHANGES IN RETAIL WE<br>
<br>
SHOULD LOOK AT OUR CONTROLS AND WE SHOULD LOOK AT WHAT OUR<br>
<br>
CHALLENGES ARE TODAY AND THE CHALLENGES THAT ARE COMING<br>
<br>
TOMORROW BECAUSE WE SEE THEY'RE COMING AND NOT RESPOND TO THE<br>
<br>
CHALLENGES OF 30 YEARS AGO BECAUSE IT IS NO LONGER APPROPRIATE AND IT DOESN'T HELP US.<br>
<br>
>> THANK YOU. THANK YOU. CHAIR MELGAR SUPERVISOR CHAN THANK YOU PRESIDENT MADAM AND I<br>
<br>
WANT TO THANK FIRST SUPERVISOR MALAGA FOR HER LEADERSHIP<br>
<br>
AND IN EVALUATING THIS AND I CAN CONCUR AND UNDERSTAND YOU<br>
<br>
THIS IS A PROBLEM SOLVING FOR HER DISTRICT IN TERMS OF WESTPORT ALL WHAT I HAVE QUESTIONS ABOUT THIS PIECE OF<br>
<br>
LEGISLATION COLLEAGUES IS THAT IN THE CONTEXT OF UPCOMING<br>
<br>
ZONING PLAN BUT ALSO THE LEGISLATION THAT WERE<br>
<br>
PREVIOUSLY APPROVED LAYERING SUCH AS FLEXIBLE USE FOR FOR<br>
<br>
OUR NEIGHBORHOOD COMMERCIAL DISTRICT AS WELL AS THE MOST<br>
<br>
RECENT OF PRIORITIZATION OF FORMULARY TILE WITH 20<br>
<br>
STOREFRONTS AND LESS AND IT IS NOT SO MUCH OF THAT I AM<br>
<br>
IN OPPOSITION OF THIS PARTICULAR LEGISLATION BUT IS<br>
<br>
MUCH MORE SO IN THE CONTEXT OF NOT JUST THE UP ZONING BUT<br>
<br>
OVERALL LAYERING OF DIFFERENT LEGISLATION AND HOW THAT<br>
<br>
ACTUALLY NOT JUST IMPACTING NEIGHBORHOOD COMMERCIAL CORRIDOR OR NEIGHBORHOOD COMMERCIAL DISTRICTS IN IN<br>
<br>
IN THE RICHMOND BUT CLEARLY ALSO IN OTHER REALLY CITY Y<br>
<br>
AND I KNOW THAT WE'RE UNIQUE WE HAVE 47 DIFFERENT NEIGHBORHOOD COMMERCIAL DISTRICT AND SOME OF THEM HAVE DIFFERENT KINDS OF<br>
<br>
RESTRICTION AND PARTICULARLY IN THE RICHMOND WE HAVE FOUR<br>
<br>
JUST GARY ALONE WE HAVE RESTRICTION ON FORMULA RETAIL AND FOOD AND FORMULA RETAIL ON PET STORE SPECIFICALLY BECAUSE<br>
<br>
OF THAT I MUST SAY THAT I HAVE QUESTIONS AND CONCERNS AND JUST<br>
<br>
WANTED TO SEEK A MORE BETTER UNDERSTANDING AND IN DEPTH<br>
<br>
ANALYSIS THAT WHEN WE DO THIS IN THE EVENT THAT FOR A LARGER<br>
<br>
LOTS CAN DO DO A DIVISION WITHOUT A CONDITIONAL USE<br>
<br>
LAYERING WITH THE FLEXIBLE USE WITHOUT ADDITIONAL CONDITIONAL<br>
<br>
USE HOW WOULD THAT ACTUALLY WORK FOR US AND WHAT DOES THAT<br>
<br>
MEAN? I GOT A CLARIFICATION YESTERDAY<br>
<br>
ON LAND USE AND THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING ME YESTERDAY AND FOR ALLOWING ME TO JOIN YESTERDAY AT LAND USE COMMITTEE<br>
<br>
THAT I CAN ASK QUESTIONS ABOUT PARCEL DELIVERY FACILITY<br>
<br>
PARTICULARLY A CLARIFICATION THAT YOU KNOW FOR THE RICHMOND<br>
<br>
IS NOT APPLICABLE FOR PARCEL DELIVERY SERVICE BUT ACTUALLY IS NOT CLEAR WHETHER THE REMAINING OF OTHER NEIGHBORHOOD<br>
<br>
COMMERCIAL DISTRICT PARCEL DELIVERY SERVICE IS TECHNICALLY<br>
<br>
BANNED IN THIS CASE WHICH WE KNOW IS HAS ACTUALLY HAS A<br>
<br>
WAIVER FOR 5000 SQUARE FOOTAGE AND LESS ALL WHICH IS TO SAY<br>
<br>
COLLEAGUES I I'M PUTTING OUT THERE AND AND AGAIN I CAN<br>
<br>
UNDERSTAND THAT THERE IS A FEELING THAT YOU KNOW, WE<br>
<br>
SHOULD MOVE FORWARD WITH THIS PIECE OF LEGISLATION TODAY<br>
<br>
SINCE THERE'S A DUPLICATE UP FILE SEEMS LIKE IT'S A WAITING<br>
<br>
FOR FURTHER AMENDMENT. I'M GOING TO PUT IT OUT THERE<br>
<br>
THAT I WANT TO ASK COLLEAGUES TO THINK ABOUT WHETHER THERE'S<br>
<br>
A POSSIBILITY TO EITHER FOR CONTINUANCE OF THIS PIECE OF<br>
<br>
LEGISLATION TODAY OR SEND IT BACK TO COMMITTEE FOR FURTHER<br>
<br>
COMMUNICATIONS AND YOU KNOW, CONVERSATIONS THAT WE CAN HAVE<br>
<br>
WITH OUR CONSTITUENTS AND PARTICULARLY FOR ME, YOU KNOW, NOT JUST I WANT TO SAY NOT JUST THAT BUSINESS LOCATED<br>
<br>
IN THE RICHMOND NEIGHBORHOOD COMMERCIAL DISTRICT BUT ALSO<br>
<br>
FRANKLY CHINESE SPEAKING AND MONOLINGUAL MERCHANTS FOR<br>
<br>
THEM TO ACTUALLY UNDERSTAND THIS PIECE OF LEGISLATION.<br>
<br>
I HAVE QUESTIONS I WOULD IMAGINE SO WHAT MY CONSTITUENTS<br>
<br>
NOT JUST IN D ONE BUT THROUGHOUT THE CITY THAT ARE<br>
<br>
PARTICULARLY CHINESE SPEAKING. >> SO I AM GOING TO THROW IT<br>
<br>
OUT THERE THAT I WILL HAVE THEM I AM PUTTING A MOTION OUT THERE<br>
<br>
FOR A CONTINUANCE AS I KNOW I WILL REQUIRE A SECOND SECOND<br>
<br>
BITE AND SO I'M GOING TO LAY IT OUT THERE AND AND FOR YOUR<br>
<br>
CONSIDERATION AND BUT AGAIN, I WANT TO I DO WANT TO THANK<br>
<br>
SUPERVISOR MAL GA FOR ALWAYS TRYING TO PROBLEM SOLVE FOR HER<br>
<br>
DISTRICT AND BUT I UNDERSTAND YOU KNOW IF THERE'S A<br>
<br>
CONSIDERATION AND COURTESY FOR PRESENT MADAM IN CARVING OUT<br>
<br>
CONTRADICTORY AND REST OF THIS ACTUALLY IMPACT MANY YOU KNOW<br>
<br>
ALL ACTUALLY NEIGHBORHOOD COMMERCIAL DISTRICT CITYWIDE<br>
<br>
I'M I YOU KNOW AND THIS WHAT CAME OUT AS COMMITTEE REPORT<br>
<br>
I'M ASKING JUST FOR MORE MORE TIME I'M NOT SAYING THAT I'M<br>
<br>
VOTING OPPOSITION I DON'T WANT TO BE IN VOTING OPPOSITION<br>
<br>
TODAY BUT IF I MUST I PROBABLY WILL FOR TODAY.<br>
<br>
SUPERVISOR CHAN JUST TO CLARIFY THE MOTION YOUR YOU HAVE MOVED<br>
<br>
TO CONTINUE THIS TO THE NEXT MEETING THE NEXT MEETING<br>
<br>
SEPTEMBER 2ND SEPTEMBER 2ND AND THAT HAS BEEN SECONDED BY<br>
<br>
SUPERVISOR CHAN SUPERVISOR SLAUGHTER THANK YOU PRESIDENT<br>
<br>
MANAGEMENT AND THANK YOU SUPERVISOR MELGAR FOR YOUR WORK<br>
<br>
ON THIS. >> I'VE HEARD CONCERNS ABOUT<br>
<br>
THIS FROM SOME COMMUNITY MEMBERS AND I WANT TO KIND OF<br>
<br>
ADDRESS THOSE BECAUSE I, I THINK THEY'RE COMING FROM A<br>
<br>
GOOD PLACE AND AND THEY'RE VALID CONCERNS AT FIRST.<br>
<br>
YOU KNOW, THE CONCERNS ARE SPEAK SOMEWHAT TO WHAT YOU WERE<br>
<br>
SHARING SUPERVISOR CHAN ON ON THE LAYERING OF THE DIFFERENT<br>
<br>
PIECES I THINK ALSO JUST THE KIND OF THE WORST CASE SCENARIO<br>
<br>
IN SOME FOLKS MINDS OF OF STOREFRONTS BEING MERGED AT WILL AND LARGE SPACES OPENING AND I TAKE ANY OF THOSE<br>
<br>
CONCERNS SERIOUSLY FOR ME I THINK ACTUALLY THIS LEGISLATION<br>
<br>
PUTS IN MORE GUARDRAILS THAN BEFORE AND IT DOES IT IN A MORE<br>
<br>
TRANSPARENT MANNER. SPECIFICALLY THIS RETAINS THE<br>
<br>
CONDITIONAL USE ABOVE 4000FT2. >> SO THAT IS A PROCESS THAT IS<br>
<br>
RETAINED IN ON THE STOREFRONT MERGER SIDE, STOREFRONT MERGERS<br>
<br>
ARE CURRENTLY NOT ALLOWED AND A LOT OF THE NCDS THAT I<br>
<br>
REPRESENT AND WE HAVE PENDING LEGISLATION TO ALLOW MORE<br>
<br>
FLEXIBILITY TO CHANGE THAT TO A CONDITIONAL USE AND IF WE ARE<br>
<br>
SUCCESSFUL THERE STILL WILL BE A CONDITIONAL USE PROCESS. SO TO ME IT IS TAKING THIS ACTION AND PUTTING IT TO A MORE<br>
<br>
IN FRONT OF A MORE OBJECTIVE SET OF STANDARDS IN A MORE<br>
<br>
TRANSPARENT MANNER. OTHERWISE WE'RE HAVING TO DO AS SUPERVISOR MELGAR EXPLAINED. WE'RE HAVING TO DO SPOT<br>
<br>
LEGISLATION AND THE QUESTION IS CAN THE GENERAL PUBLIC FOLLOW<br>
<br>
THAT LEGISLATIVE PROCESS WHICH IS DONE AT THE WILL AND THE<br>
<br>
SUBJECTIVE WILL OF AN INDIVIDUAL SUPERVISOR OR DO<br>
<br>
THEY FOLLOW A PLANNING PROCESS BETTER? NEITHER ARE EASY TO FOLLOW BUT THE PLANNING PROCESS DOES COME<br>
<br>
WITH A NOTICE REQUIREMENT AND SO IF YOU'RE INTERESTED<br>
<br>
IN COMMUNITY INPUT AND DOING THINGS TRANSPARENTLY I THINK<br>
<br>
THERE'S ACTUALLY A CASE TO BE SAID THAT THIS DOES IT IN A MORE TRANSPARENT MANNER. I ALSO REALLY APPRECIATE THE<br>
<br>
THE PIECE OF THIS LEGISLATION AND I THINK THE PROBABLY THE PIECE THAT WILL BE MOST IMPACTFUL OVER TIME IS THE<br>
<br>
SUBDIVIDING OF SMALLER SPACES. I THINK THAT IS A SIGNIFICANT<br>
<br>
ISSUE THAT THERE'S NOT ENOUGH ATTENTION ON CITYWIDE OF THESE<br>
<br>
MASSIVE LARGE SPACES WHICH ARE JUST NOT IN DEMAND FOR RETAIL<br>
<br>
ANYMORE AND SOMETHING LIKE THIS MAKING IT EASIER TO SUBDIVIDE I<br>
<br>
THINK ACTUALLY GOES ADVANCES THE GOAL THAT MANY OF US SHARE<br>
<br>
OF THIS SMALL NEIGHBORHOOD SERVING RETAIL IT ALSO ADVANCES<br>
<br>
THE GOAL THAT MANY OF US SHARE OF OF MORE AFFORDABLE RENTS<br>
<br>
WHICH ARE MORE ATTAINABLE WITH SMALLER SPACES. SO ON THE BALANCE I THINK IT IS A GOOD PIECE OF LEGISLATION.<br>
<br>
I ALSO YOU KNOW RECOGNIZING THOSE CONCERNS I NOTICE IT HAS<br>
<br>
BEEN DUPLICATED AND I THINK THERE'S YOU KNOW THAT WOULD BE AN AVENUE TO DO FURTHER WORK. I WILL NOT SUPPORT A WELL LET<br>
<br>
ME PUT IT THIS WAY I'LL I'LL I'LL LOOK TO HEAR FROM<br>
<br>
SUPERVISOR MELGAR ON THE ISSUE OF CONTINUANCE.<br>
<br>
>> THANKS. SUPERVISOR CHERYL THANK YOU<br>
<br>
PRESIDENT GENTLEMAN I JUST WANT TO THANK SUPERVISOR MELGAR FOR<br>
<br>
REALLY, REALLY LEANING INTO THIS HARD BEING INCREDIBLY THOUGHTFUL AT THE END OF THE DAY THIS IS ABOUT MAKING IT<br>
<br>
EASIER FOR SMALL BUSINESSES TO FILL SPACES THAT LARGE CHAIN<br>
<br>
STORES CAN NO LONGER FILL BECAUSE OF RETAIL TRENDS THAT<br>
<br>
ARE TOTALLY OUTSIDE OF SAN FRANCISCO. HE SPOKE ABOUT IT VERY, VERY WELL AND I THINK SUPERVISOR<br>
<br>
SAUTER TOUCHED ON IT AS WELL GIVING LANDLORDS THE ABILITY TO<br>
<br>
SUBDIVIDE SPACES INTO SIGNIFICANTLY SMALLER SPACES<br>
<br>
OFFERS NEW OPPORTUNITIES FOR SAN FRANCISCO CREATIVE<br>
<br>
ENTREPRENEURS FOR FOR PEOPLE WITHOUT CORPORATE BACKING, FOR<br>
<br>
IMMIGRANTS, FOR FOR YOUNG PEOPLE TO START BUSINESSES HERE<br>
<br>
IN SAN FRANCISCO AND FILL PERSISTENTLY VACANT SPACES.<br>
<br>
THIS IS ABOUT CREATING OPPORTUNITY BY MAKING UNFILMABLE LARGE SPACES INTO FILLABLE SMALL SPACES<br>
<br>
SUPERVISOR MCGRATH THANK YOU FOR WEIGHING IN ON THIS SO<br>
<br>
HEAVILY AND SO SPECIFICALLY. CHAIR MILLER ANY OBJECTION TO<br>
<br>
LETTING SUPERVISOR WALTON GO FIRST?<br>
<br>
>> ALL RIGHT. THANK YOU PRESIDENT MADAM AND I<br>
<br>
GUESS MY QUESTION IS TO THE CHAIR AS WHY DOES THIS HAVE TO<br>
<br>
HAPPEN RIGHT NOW? LIKE IF IF THERE ARE CONCERNS<br>
<br>
IN COMMUNITIES, WHY CAN'T THERE BE AT LEAST MORE CONVERSATION<br>
<br>
BEFORE HAVING TO VOTE ON THIS TODAY?<br>
<br>
>> CHAIR MELGAR THANK YOU PRESIDENT MANDEL MAN I THINK<br>
<br>
THIS IS ACTUALLY REALLY SMALL. WE DO HAVE YOU KNOW THESE<br>
<br>
ISSUES WITH A LARGE SPACES THAT YOU KNOW NOW WILL HAVE AN<br>
<br>
EASIER WAY TO SUBDIVIDE CHEAPER, CHEAPER AND EASIER<br>
<br>
AND THAT IS SOMETHING THAT AFFECTS ALL OF US. I HAVE NOT GOTTEN ANY OPPOSITION FROM ANYONE ABOUT<br>
<br>
THAT A PART OF THE LEGISLATION IN FACT, YOU KNOW THE MERCHANTS<br>
<br>
ON YOU KNOW, THE COMMERCIAL CORRIDORS ARE AFFECTED BY THE<br>
<br>
OTHER PART OF THE LEGISLATURE ACTUALLY QUITE THIS LIKE THIS<br>
<br>
QUITE A BIT AND I THINK THAT IT'S RELIEF FOR A LOT OF FOLKS<br>
<br>
. I THINK THAT YOU KNOW, I WANT<br>
<br>
TO ADDRESS SOME OF THE ISSUES THAT HAVE COME UP BECAUSE I DON'T THINK THERE ARE ISSUES AND LIKE I SAID, I THINK THIS<br>
<br>
IS REALLY SMALL IN WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO MOVE IT FORWARD TODAY I<br>
<br>
DID DUPLICATE THE FILE IN CASE THERE ARE, YOU KNOW, ISSUES<br>
<br>
THAT PEOPLE STILL WANT TO TINKER AROUND OR SOMEONE ELSE<br>
<br>
WANTS YOU KNOW, TO GO FURTHER AT THE LEGISLATIONS ALREADY<br>
<br>
WRITTEN AND WE CAN AMEND IT BUT I, I DON'T SEE A NEED TO DELAY<br>
<br>
IT. LET ME JUST SAY THERE ARE NO<br>
<br>
NEIGHBORHOOD COMMERCIAL CORRIDORS WHERE DELIVERY PARCEL<br>
<br>
DELIVERY IS PERMITTED. THERE ARE THREE WAYS YOU KNOW THAT WE DEAL WITH IT. IT'S EITHER, YOU KNOW, PROHIBIT<br>
<br>
IT OR IT IS PERMITTED OR YOU KNOW, PERMITTED WITH A<br>
<br>
CONDITIONAL USE AND IN NO NEIGHBORHOOD COMMERCIAL<br>
<br>
CORRIDOR IS PARCEL DELIVERY AT THE 5000FT2 OR LESS PERMITTED.<br>
<br>
SO YOU KNOW, I DON'T THINK THAT'S AN ISSUE FOR ANY OF YOU<br>
<br>
WHO HAVE NEIGHBORHOOD COMMERCIAL CORRIDORS IN YOUR DISTRICT BECAUSE IT IS LITERALLY PROHIBITED IN THIS<br>
<br>
LEGISLATION DOES NOT CHANGE THAT. I THINK THAT FOR THAT CONTROVERSIAL PART OF THIS<br>
<br>
LEGISLATION WHICH IS THE USE SIZE CAP, THERE ARE ONLY THREE<br>
<br>
COMMERCIAL CORRIDORS THAT ARE AFFECTED AND I HAVE SPOKEN TO ALL THE SUPERVISORS THERE AND WE HAVE WORKED IT OUT IN A<br>
<br>
WAY THAT IS SATISFACTORY TO THOSE SUPERVISORS.<br>
<br>
SO I JUST DON'T SEE THE NEED FOR THE DELAY.<br>
<br>
LIKE I SAID, I THINK THIS IS QUITE SMALL AND IT WILL BRING<br>
<br>
RELIEF TO NEIGHBORHOOD COMMERCIAL CORRIDORS THAT HAVE<br>
<br>
THESE LARGE PIECES THAT HAVE BEEN VACANT. >> THANK YOU. >> SUPER SUPERVISOR CHAN THANK<br>
<br>
YOU PRESIDENT RANDLEMAN COLLEAGUES I THINK WHEN THIS<br>
<br>
ITEM CAME BEFORE THE LAND USE COMMITTEE I EXPRESSED THEIR<br>
<br>
GRAVE CONCERN REGARDING THIS LEGISLATION.<br>
<br>
ONE IS THE PORTION OF THE LEGISLATION THAT REMOVES THE USE SIZE CAPS IN SOME NEIGHBORHOOD COMMERCIAL<br>
<br>
DISTRICT MAY SEEM LIKE A MODEST CHANGE BUT THIS CONTROLS WERE<br>
<br>
PUT IN PLACE IN ORDER TO PROTECT SMALL BUSINESS FROM<br>
<br>
BEING SQUEEZED OUT BY LARGEST BUSINESS WITH MORE RESOURCES<br>
<br>
MUCH IN GROUPS. >> MULTIPLE MERCHANT GROUPS CAME TO ME AND EXPRESSED THEIR STRONG OPPOSITION TO<br>
<br>
ELIMINATION OF THE EXISTING LIMITS BECAUSE THEY UNDERSTAND<br>
<br>
THAT REMOVING THE CAPS COULD UNDERMINE THE VITALITY OF<br>
<br>
NEIGHBORHOOD COMMERCIAL DISTRICT.<br>
<br>
THIS WILL ALSO OPEN DOOR FOR BIGGER AND WHILE RESOURCES TO RETAIL TENANTS TO EXPAND THEIR FOOTPRINT AND PLACE UPWARD<br>
<br>
PRESSURE ON RENTS I ALSO BELIEVE THAT THERE IS ANOTHER<br>
<br>
MORE UNKNOWN FACTOR WHICH IS WILL COME TO US VERY SOON.<br>
<br>
>> IT'S WITH THE MAYOR'S REZONING OF THE CITY COMMERCIAL<br>
<br>
CORRIDOR COMING FORWARD THERE WILL BE UNDOUBTEDLY BE<br>
<br>
DEMOLITION OF BUILDINGS WITH MULTIPLE SMALL BUILDINGS<br>
<br>
AND THIS LEGISLATION CAN ALSO OPEN DOOR TO NEW DEVELOPMENT<br>
<br>
THAT COULD INCLUDE LARGER STOREFRONT FOOTPRINT THAT WILL<br>
<br>
BE AN AFFORDABLE TO SMALL BUSINESS. >> SO WITH THE LEGISLATION AS OF TODAY I AM NOT READY TO<br>
<br>
SUPPORT BUT IN COMMITTEE I DID DUPLICATE A FILE AND I DO HOPE<br>
<br>
THAT WE CAN HAVE MORE TIME AND LOOK INTO IT SO WE CAN<br>
<br>
ADDRESS SOME OF THOSE MERCHANTS CONCERN.<br>
<br>
THANK YOU. UH, SUPERVISOR CHEN JUST WANTED<br>
<br>
TO BRIEFLY MENTION THAT YOU KNOW IT'S WE JUST RECEIVED IT<br>
<br>
THIS AFTERNOON AND I JUST WANT TO MAKE MENTION THAT, YOU KNOW,<br>
<br>
AN ORGANIZATION, A CITY WIDE ORGANIZATION KNOWN AS SMALL<br>
<br>
BUSINESS FOUR HAS ARTICULATED AGAIN NOT IN OPPOSITION TO THE<br>
<br>
LEGISLATION BUT ALSO JUST SIMPLY ASKING FOR A CONTINUANCE. SO THAT DIFFERENT MERCHANT<br>
<br>
GROUPS CITYWIDE CAN HAVE A BETTER UNDERSTANDING ABOUT THE<br>
<br>
IMPACT ON NEIGHBORHOOD COMMERCIAL DISTRICTS.<br>
<br>
I THINK THAT AGAIN THE PERSPECTIVE ABOUT WHETHER IT'S<br>
<br>
A MINOR CHANGE OR NOT I THINK IT'S THE PROSPECT OF ABOUT<br>
<br>
UNDERSTANDING THE IMPACT AND HOW IT ACTUALLY LAYERS<br>
<br>
AND I CONCUR WITH SUPERVISOR CHEN'S SENTIMENT ABOUT THIS IS<br>
<br>
REALLY ALSO IN THE CONTEXT OF THE UPCOMING UP ZONING PLAN<br>
<br>
PROPOSED BY THE MAYOR AND HELP US ACTUALLY ALL UNDERSTAND HOW<br>
<br>
THIS ACTUALLY WOULD WORK OUT FOR PARTICULARLY FOR THE<br>
<br>
NEIGHBORHOOD COMMERCIAL DISTRICT. >> THANK YOU, CHAIRMAN. ALOHA.<br>
<br>
I WILL JUST MAKE ONE LAST POINT AND LET THIS ONE GO.<br>
<br>
SO YOU KNOW FOR NEW CONSTRUCTION THE EXISTING<br>
<br>
CONTROLS STILL APPLY. SO IF IT'S A SPACE THAT'S<br>
<br>
LARGER THAN 4000, 5000 SQUARE FOOT WHEREVER THAT IS, YOU<br>
<br>
STILL NEED TO GO THROUGH A CONDITIONAL USE.<br>
<br>
THERE ARE SOME AREAS WHERE THINGS ARE STREAMLINED.<br>
<br>
THAT IS THE CASE AND IT IS A VERY SMALL SCENARIO NOT<br>
<br>
NECESSARILY CONNECTED TO THE OBSERVING BUT I WILL ALSO SAY,<br>
<br>
YOU KNOW IN THE EXPERIENCES THAT I HAD WITH A CAP ON WEST<br>
<br>
PORTAL IT IN ALSO IT HAPPENED WITH THE FORMER SUPERVISOR<br>
<br>
DISTRICT THREE WITH BOB'S DONUTS WHEN THE SPOT ZONING HAPPENED IS BECAUSE YOU HAVE THAT ACCESS TO YOUR SUPERVISOR<br>
<br>
WHO CAN WRITE LEGISLATION JUST FOR YOUR BUSINESS AND YOU CAN<br>
<br>
PAY YOU KNOW BRANT GLADSTONE OR WHOEVER LAND USE LAWYER $700 AN<br>
<br>
HOUR OR PAY AN EXPEDITER TO DO THIS FOR YOU.<br>
<br>
IT IS NOT THE SMALL IMMIGRANT BUSINESSES THAT ARE BENEFITING<br>
<br>
FROM OUR CURRENT REALLY RESTRICTIVE CONTROLS. IT IS THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE ACCESS WHO HAVE MONEY TO PAY<br>
<br>
THE LAND USE LAWYERS AND I THINK THAT WE ARE DOING A<br>
<br>
DISSERVICE TO A SMALL IMMIGRANT NON-ENGLISH SPEAKING PEOPLE BY<br>
<br>
HAVING THESE RESTRICTIONS THAT ONLY ALLOW ACCESS FOR SOME<br>
<br>
AND NOT OTHERS. AND SO I JUST WANTED TO SAY THAT THANK YOU. >> ALL RIGHT, MADAM CLERK, ON<br>

AMENDED WITH THE SAME TITLE IT READS ORDINANCE TO AMEND THE<br>

ADMINISTRATIVE CODE TO REVISE THE GOALS AND REPORTING REQUIREMENTS FOR FOOD PURCHASING BY THE DEPARTMENT OF<br>
<br>

<br>
KIDDING. THANK YOU SO MUCH, PRESIDENT MADAM IN. COLLEAGUES YESTERDAY ON RULES<br>

COMMITTEE WE AMENDED AND DUPLICATED THE FAILED TO<br>
<br>
REMOVE A PROVISION REQUIRING THE.<br>
<br>
TO SOURCE 5% OF FOOD FROM MEDIUM AND SMALL FARMS BY<br>
<br>
JANUARY 2027 AND INCREASE SOURCING TO 10 TO 15% BY<br>
<br>
JANUARY 2028. >> THIS CHANGE WILL ALLOW DPS TO EVALUATE AND ANALYZE THE UPDATED GOALS OVER THE AUGUST<br>
<br>
RECESS. THESE SOURCING TARGETS WERE<br>
<br>
ORIGINALLY ESTABLISHED BY H AND COORDINATION WITH THE<br>
<br>
CENTER FOR GOOD FOOD PURCHASING IN 2000 1920 WHICH IS WHY THEY<br>
<br>
WERE INCLUDED IN THIS LEGISLATION INITIALLY. >> THIS POLICY WAS REINTRODUCED BECAUSE THE CURRENT POLICY IS<br>
<br>
SET TO EXPIRE IN SEPTEMBER AND THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY TO<br>
<br>
STRENGTHEN OUR GOALS AROUND SUSTAINABILITY, HEALTH, LABOR<br>
<br>
PRACTICES AND LOCAL FOOD SOURCING BY ENSURING THAT SAN<br>
<br>
FRANCISCO'S PUBLIC DOLLARS SUPPORT ETHICAL FOOD SYSTEMS<br>
<br>
THAT UPLIFT WORKERS AND COMMUNITIES. AFTER FURTHER DISCUSSIONS WITH MY COLLEAGUES WHO SUPPORT THE<br>
<br>
POLICY BUT REQUESTED A SUNSET DATE, WE'VE REACHED AN<br>
<br>

<br>
MY OPEN FOR BUSINESS CONTRACT STREAMLINING ACT OF 2025<br>

ENDEAVORS TO ESTABLISH TIME LIMITS FOR SOME OF OUR SOCIAL<br>

<br>
REQUIREMENTS. AND SO I WANT TO THANK THANK<br>
<br>
THE CHAIR FOR BEING WILLING TO ACCOMMODATE THAT REQUEST<br>
<br>
IN THIS PARTICULAR PIECE OF LEGISLATION. >> I THINK I HOPE WE CAN TAKE THAT MOTION WITHOUT OBJECTION.<br>

<br>
A ROLL CALL FIRST MEMBER OF TO INTRODUCE NEW BUSINESS IS<br>
<br>
SUPERVISOR AND ENGARDIO. THANK YOU COLLEAGUES TODAY I'M<br>
<br>
REQUESTING A HEARING TO EVALUATE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF<br>
<br>
THE CITY'S PROGRAMS AND TAX INCENTIVES INTENDED TO<br>
<br>
REVITALIZE OUR BEAUTIFUL COMMERCIAL CORRIDORS. THIS HEARING WILL FOCUS ON THREE KEY INITIATIVES THE<br>
<br>
DEPARTMENT OF BUILDING INSPECTIONS VACANT OR ABANDONED<br>
<br>
COMMERCIAL STOREFRONT REGISTRY THE TREASURER AND TAX COLLECTORS COMMERCIAL VACANCY TAX AND THE SAN FRANCISCO<br>
<br>
PUBLIC WORKS GRAFFITI ABATEMENT OPTION PROGRAM.<br>
<br>
AT FIRST GLANCE THESE PROGRAMS MAY SEEM DISTINCT BUT TOGETHER<br>
<br>
THEY REFLECT THE CITY'S BROADER STRATEGY TO PREVENT COMMERCIAL<br>
<br>
PROPERTY BLIGHT DISCOURAGE COMMERCIAL STOREFRONT VACANCIES<br>
<br>
AND SUPPORT THE LONG TERM HEALTH OF OUR NEIGHBORHOOD COMMERCIAL CORRIDORS. VACANT AND POORLY MAINTAINED<br>
<br>
STOREFRONTS DO MORE THAN AFFECT THE LOOK AND FEEL OF A<br>
<br>
CORRIDOR. THEY UNDERMINE COMMUNITY CONFIDENCE, DETER FOOT TRAFFIC AND DISCOURAGE SMALL BUSINESS<br>
<br>
INVESTMENT. IN RECENT YEARS SAN FRANCISCO<br>
<br>
HAS TAKEN MEANINGFUL STEPS TO ADDRESS THESE CHALLENGES THROUGH TARGETED POLICIES. EACH WAS DESIGNED TO REDUCE<br>
<br>
LONG TERM VACANCIES, IMPROVE THE CONDITION AND APPEARANCE OF<br>
<br>
COMMERCIAL PROPERTIES AND MAINTAIN THE VIBRANCY OF OUR SHARED PUBLIC SPACES. HOWEVER, IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE<br>
<br>
THAT TWO OF THESE PROGRAMS THE VACANT OR ABANDONED COMMERCIAL STOREFRONT REGISTRY AND THE COMMERCIAL VACANCY TAX WERE<br>
<br>
ADOPTED BEFORE THE ONSET OF THE COVID 19 PANDEMIC WHICH<br>
<br>
PROFOUNDLY RESHAPED OUR CITY'S ECONOMIC LANDSCAPE.<br>
<br>
A MARCH 3RD 2020 JUST TWO WEEKS BEFORE COVID 19 LOCKDOWNS WENT<br>
<br>
INTO EFFECT, SAN FRANCISCO VOTERS PASSED THE COMMERCIAL<br>
<br>
VACANCY TAX AND IN FALL 2023 THIS BOARD SUSPENDED<br>
<br>
IMPLEMENTATION OF THE VACANT OR ABANDONED COMMERCIAL STOREFRONT<br>
<br>
REGISTRY FOR AN ENTIRE YEAR. >> BUT TODAY SAN FRANCISCO HAS<br>
<br>
TWO OVERLAPPING COMMERCIAL VACANCY PROGRAMS EACH ADMINISTERED BY TWO SEPARATE DEPARTMENTS.<br>
<br>
THIS RAISES IMPORTANT QUESTIONS.<br>
<br>
ARE THESE PROGRAMS EFFECTIVELY REDUCING LONG TERM VACANCIES? ARE THEY HELPING TO PREVENT COMMERCIAL BLIGHT IN OUR<br>
<br>
NEIGHBORHOODS? AND JUST AS CRITICALLY, WHO ARE<br>
<br>
THESE PROGRAMS REALLY SERVING? ARE WE UNINTENTIONALLY PLACING<br>
<br>
AN UNDUE BURDEN ON SMALL MOM AND POP PROPERTY OWNERS NAVIGATING SHORT TERM VACANCIES?<br>
<br>
CONVERSELY, ARE WE ALLOWING LONG TERM ABSENTEE LANDLORDS TO<br>
<br>
AVOID RESPONSIBILITY WHILE THE CITY ABSORBS THE COSTS OF<br>
<br>
MAINTAINING THE EXTERNAL APPEARANCE OF THEIR BLIGHTED PROPERTIES? THESE ARE THE QUESTIONS WE MUST<br>
<br>
ANSWER IF WE'RE SERIOUS ABOUT RESTORING THE VITALITY OF OUR<br>
<br>
COMMERCIAL CORRIDORS AND MAKING SURE CITY POLICY REFLECTS BOTH<br>
<br>
FAIRNESS AND IMPACT. >> AND COLLEAGUES, I'M ALSO<br>
<br>
MAKING A FORMAL LEGISLATIVE DRAFTING REQUEST OF THE CITY ATTORNEY TO HELP STREAMLINE AND CONSOLIDATE PERMIT FEES<br>
<br>
LISTED IN SAN FRANCISCO'S BUSINESS TAX AND REGULATIONS<br>
<br>
CODE. >> I KNOW ADMINISTRATIVE CODE<br>
<br>
CLEANUP IS NOT THE MOST EXCITING TOPIC BUT IT IS EXACTLY THIS SORT OF STREAMLINING CODE<br>
<br>
SIMPLIFICATION AND CLEANUP OF ANTIQUATED PERMIT REQUIREMENTS<br>
<br>
THAT HELPS DEMYSTIFY LOCAL GOVERNMENT AND HELPS MAKE OUR<br>
<br>
CITY CHARTER EASIER TO ADMINISTER AND UNDERSTAND.<br>
<br>
AND IT ALLOWS MORE CITIZENS AND MERCHANTS TO UNDERSTAND THE COSTS AND COMPLEXITY ASSOCIATED WITH DOING BUSINESS IN SAN<br>
<br>
FRANCISCO. OUR BUSINESS TAX<br>
<br>
AND REGULATIONS CODE COVERS ALL KINDS OF OBSCURE THINGS FROM<br>
<br>
BALLOON ADVERTISING LICENSE REQUIREMENTS FOR VENDING<br>
<br>
MACHINES TO BIRD EXHIBITIONS AND BOWLING ALLEYS.<br>
<br>
IT GOES INTO GREAT DETAIL TO SPECIFY THE FEES AND PERMIT REQUIREMENTS THE CITY IS SUPPOSED TO IMPOSE AND COLLECT<br>
<br>
ON TARGETED INDUSTRIES. SOME SECTIONS IN OUR BUSINESS<br>
<br>
TAX AND REGULATIONS CODE HAVE BEEN ON THE BOOKS FOR NEARLY A<br>
<br>
CENTURY. BUT MANY OF THESE INDUSTRIES NO LONGER OPERATE IN THE CITY AND TODAY SOME AREN'T EVEN<br>
<br>
LEGAL TO OPERATE IN SAN FRANCISCO.<br>
<br>
MY STAFF HAS IDENTIFIED NEARLY 100 OBSCURE FEES AND CHARGES<br>
<br>
THAT CITY DEPARTMENTS ARE MEANT TO COLLECT FROM BUSINESSES.<br>
<br>
BUT AN OVERWHELMING MAJORITY OF THESE FEE CATEGORIES ARE NOT<br>
<br>
FOUND IN DEPARTMENT BUDGET SUBMISSIONS.<br>
<br>
MORE THAN SEVERAL LINE ITEM FEE CATEGORIES ARE ISSUED TO FEWER<br>
<br>
THAN FIVE BUSINESSES EACH YEAR. A FEW DOZEN LINE ITEM FEE CATEGORIES ARE ISSUED TO LESS THAN 20 BUSINESSES ANNUALLY.<br>
<br>
>> ON AVERAGE EACH FEE WE REVIEWED GENERATES LESS THAN<br>
<br>
$15,000 FOR DEPARTMENTS EACH YEAR AND NO FEE THAT WE REVIEW GENERATES MORE THAN 100,000 IN ANNUAL REVENUE.<br>
<br>
THAT IS WHY I'M ASKING THE CITY'S ATTORNEYS CITY<br>
<br>
ATTORNEY'S OFFICE WITH SUPPORT FROM THE COMPTROLLER TO HELP IDENTIFY ADDITIONAL OBSCURE PERMITS CODIFIED IN OUR<br>
<br>
BUSINESS, TECH AND TAX AND REGULATIONS CODE THAT<br>
<br>
GENERATE LESS THAN $100,000 IN REVENUE FOR CITY<br>
<br>
DEPARTMENTS. I BELIEVE IT'S POSSIBLE TO<br>
<br>
SIMPLIFY THE CITY'S CODE AND BRING IT INTO THE 21ST CENTURY. THERE ARE AMPLE OPPORTUNITIES<br>
<br>
TO MAKE SAN FRANCISCO'S PERMITS AND FEES EASIER TO COLLECT<br>
<br>
AND ADMINISTER. >> THANK YOU COLLEAGUES AND THE REST I SUBMIT. >> THANK YOU.<br>
<br>
SUPERVISOR AND GUARDIAN SUPERVISOR FIELDER.<br>
<br>
>> THANK YOU, MADAM CLERK. COLLEAGUES, I HAVE TWO<br>
<br>
RESOLUTIONS FOR INTRODUCTIONS TODAY.<br>
<br>
FIRST OFF I WANT TO ADDRESS AN URGENT MATTER.<br>
<br>
>> PRESIDENT TRUMP IS ONCE AGAIN ATTACKING OUR SAN<br>
<br>
FRANCISCO VALUES AND OUR MOST VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES. JUST LAST WEEK HE SIGNED AN EXECUTIVE ORDER PURPORTING TO<br>
<br>
CRIMINALIZE MENTAL ILLNESS AND POVERTY WHILE DEFUNDING<br>
<br>
EVIDENCE BASED SOLUTIONS THAT ACTUALLY WORK.<br>
<br>
>> THE CITY HAS STOOD UP AGAINST THE TRUMP<br>
<br>
ADMINISTRATION'S CRUELTY TOWARDS IMMIGRANTS AND THE LGBTQ COMMUNITY. >> TODAY WE MUST STAND UP FOR<br>
<br>
OUR UNHOUSED RESIDENTS WHO ARE DESPERATELY TRYING TO CHANGE<br>
<br>
THEIR OWN SITUATION AND FIND REAL HOUSING STABILITY.<br>
<br>
NOBODY WANTS TO BE HOMELESS. THEIR CIRCUMSTANCES NEVER<br>
<br>
APPEAR DESIRE ACCORDING TO OUR PUBLIC DASHBOARDS.<br>
<br>
>> SAN FRANCISCO AS HAS NEARLY 18,000 PEOPLE THROUGH PERMANENT<br>
<br>
SUPPORTIVE HOUSING. THAT'S NOT JUST SYNTHETIC<br>
<br>
POLICY AND NUMBERS PLACED ON A GRAPH.<br>
<br>
>> THAT'S REAL ACTUAL HUMAN LIVES CHANGED.<br>
<br>
>> 83% OF THOSE PLACED IN PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING<br>
<br>
STAY FOR MANY YEARS. >> IMAGINE 18,000 PEOPLE BACK<br>
<br>
ON THE STREETS. >> THAT'S CHASE CENTER TOTALLY<br>
<br>
FILLED. THAT'S 327 FULLY PACKED MUNI<br>
<br>
BUSSES AND WE CAN STILL DO WAY BETTER.<br>
<br>
SAN FRANCISCO HAS A RESOURCES. THIS IS WHAT HOUSING FIRST<br>
<br>
LOOKS LIKE IN ACTION. IT RAISES THE BAR FOR THE ENTIRE CITY TO BE BETTER BECAUSE HOUSING FIRST AND HARM<br>
<br>
REDUCTION DO SAVE LIVES. >> TRUMP'S ORDER THREATENS TO<br>
<br>
WITHHOLD FEDERAL HOMELESSNESS AND MENTAL HEALTH FUNDS FROM<br>
<br>
JURISDICTIONS THAT REFUSE TO CRIMINALIZE POVERTY AND ADDICTION. IT TAKES RESOURCES AWAY FROM<br>
<br>
POLICIES THAT ACTUALLY WORK. IT IS PUNISHMENT FOR COMPASSION<br>
<br>
AND EVIDENCE BASED STRATEGIES AND THAT IS UNACCEPTABLE.<br>
<br>
AND HE'S ALREADY STARTED HE'S STARTED WITH CUTTING $3.6<br>
<br>
BILLION IN HUD HOMELESS GRANTS THAT ARE NOW FROZEN.<br>
<br>
>> 60,000 HOUSEHOLDS ARE AT RISK OF LOSING THEIR EMERGENCY<br>
<br>
HOUSING VOUCHERS NATIONALLY. HIS BUDGET PROPOSES OVER $1<br>
<br>
BILLION NATIONALLY IN CUTS TO MENTAL HEALTH AND ADDICTION TREATMENT. >> AND IN SAN FRANCISCO WE<br>
<br>
RECEIVED 63 MILLION DOLLARS IN FEDERAL FUNDING FOR<br>
<br>
HOMELESSNESS ALONE. NOW AT RISK OF BEING DEFUNDED<br>
<br>
BECAUSE MAKE NO MISTAKE THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION'S CRUELTY<br>
<br>
IS THE POINT HE WANTS US TO EVICT, INCARCERATE<br>
<br>
AND ABANDONED PEOPLE. HE WANTS TO DEFUND WHAT WORKS<br>
<br>
BECAUSE IT'S NOT PUNITIVE ENOUGH.<br>
<br>
>> BUT DONALD TRUMP DOES NOT GET TO DICTATE HOW SAN FRANCISCO OPERATES. >> HE WAS NOT ELECTED HERE.<br>
<br>
HOUSING FIRST WORKS WHEN WE PROVIDE A HOME AND SUPPORT<br>
<br>
INSTEAD OF CONDITIONS AND ULTIMATUMS AND RED TAPE.<br>
<br>
PEOPLE SURVIVE WHEN PEOPLE HAVE A HOME AND ALLOWS THEM TO<br>
<br>
RECEIVE SERVICES. >> IT IS UNREALISTIC TO EXPECT<br>
<br>
OUR VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES TO DO MORE WHEN THEY DON'T EVEN<br>
<br>
HAVE A ROOF OVER THEIR HEADS. SO LET'S BE CLEAR MOVING AWAY<br>
<br>
FROM HOUSING FIRST MEANS THAT WE'VE CONCEDED THE FIGHT AND HAVE GIVEN IN TO DONALD TRUMP AND THE MAGA AGENDA.<br>
<br>
>> IT MEANS REJECTING POLICIES THAT AFFIRM THE DIGNITY<br>
<br>
AND POTENTIAL OF EVERY PERSON STRUGGLING WITH HOMELESSNESS.<br>
<br>
>> LET'S DOUBLE DOWN ON WHAT WORKS.<br>
<br>
>> UNTIL WE TRULY INVEST IN AFFORDABLE HOUSING, SHELTER<br>
<br>
AND COMPREHENSIVE SERVICES, WE HAVE NO BUSINESS TO DISMANTLE<br>
<br>
LAYING THE FRAGILE REFUGE FOR SO MANY THAT WE FOUGHT HARD TO SECURE. >> AND THEN SECONDLY, I'M<br>
<br>
INTRODUCING RESOLUTION TO UPHOLD SAN FRANCISCO'S VALUES<br>
<br>
AND SUPPORT OUR IMMIGRANT RESIDENTS ONCE AGAIN WITH<br>
<br>
TEMPORARY PROTECTED STATUS TPS .<br>
<br>
TBS IS A TEMPORARY LEGAL STATUS FOR IMMIGRANTS GRANTED TO GROUPS OF ELIGIBLE INDIVIDUALS FROM COUNTRIES EXPERIENCING<br>
<br>
INSTABILITY DUE TO NATURAL OR ENVIRONMENTAL DISASTERS,<br>
<br>
POLITICAL UNREST, WARFARE ETC. .<br>
<br>
>> THE TPS PROGRAM HAS BEEN IN PLACE SINCE 1990<br>
<br>
AND CURRENTLY ENCOMPASSES 16 COUNTRIES EL SALVADOR, HAITI,<br>
<br>
HONDURAS. NEPAL.<br>
<br>
NICARAGUA. SOMALIA. SOUTH SUDAN. SUDAN.<br>
<br>
SYRIA. YEMEN. VENEZUELA. UKRAINE. AFGHANISTAN. ETHIOPE BIA CAMEROON AND BURMA.<br>
<br>
IN THE US THERE ARE OVER 1 MILLION TPS HOLDERS MANY OF<br>
<br>
WHOM HAVE BEEN HERE FOR 27 YEARS.<br>
<br>
THEY HAVE BUILT FAMILIES HAVE U.S. CITIZEN SPOUSES, CHILDREN<br>
<br>
AND GRANDCHILDREN. >> THEY ARE OUR NEIGHBORS ARE<br>
<br>
FRIENDS, OUR COWORKERS AND OUR FAMILIES.<br>
<br>
>> SINCE TAKING OFFICE, THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION HAS BURIED OUR COMMUNITIES WITH DAILY DECLARATIONS AND EXECUTIVE<br>
<br>
ORDERS ATTEMPTING TO SEPARATE FAMILIES AND REMOVE ALL AVENUES<br>
<br>
FOR IMMIGRANTS TO REMAIN IN THIS COUNTRY.<br>
<br>
>> CUTTING ESTABLISHED PROGRAMS DENYING DUE PROCESS AND USING<br>
<br>
DRACONIAN AND OFTEN ILLEGAL ENFORCEMENT DETENTION<br>
<br>
AND DEPORTATION TACTICS IN DEFIANCE OF THE US CONSTITUTION. >> SINCE JANUARY THE DEPARTMENT<br>
<br>
OF HOMELAND SECURITY HAS TERMINATED TPS FROM<br>
<br>
AFGHANISTAN, CAMEROON, HAITI, HONDURAS, NICARAGUA AND NEPAL<br>
<br>
IMPACTING HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF INDIVIDUALS FROM COUNTRIES<br>
<br>
WITH VERIFIABLY AND PERSISTENTLY UNSAFE<br>
<br>
CONDITIONS. >> AND MORE COUNTRIES ARE EXPECTED. THE TERMINATION OF TPS AFFECTS<br>
<br>
OUR IMMIGRANT COMMUNITIES IN SAN FRANCISCO AND THAT IS<br>
<br>
WHY OUR CITY HAS FILED AMICUS BRIEFS IN SUPPORT OF PLAINTIFFS<br>
<br>
IN SEVERAL LAWSUITS TO PROTECT TPS HOLDERS. THANKS TO THE EFFORTS OF OUR CITY ATTORNEY DAVID CHU, THIS<br>
<br>
RESOLUTION UPHOLDS SAN FRANCISCO'S SUPPORT FOR TPS<br>
<br>
HOLDERS, RECOGNIZES THEIR INVALUABLE CONTRIBUTIONS TO SAN<br>
<br>
FRANCISCO AND CALLS ON OUR CALIFORNIA DELEGATION TO<br>
<br>
PROTECT TPS IN CONGRESS AND SEEK A PERMANENT PATHWAY<br>
<br>
FOR TPS HOLDERS. I WANT TO THANK EARLY CO-SPONSORS SUPERVISORS WALTON, MELGAR, CHAN AND CHEN AND TO<br>
<br>
CARESS AND SAN FRANCISCO THE LATINO TASK FORCE AND THE<br>
<br>
NATIONAL TPS ALLIANCE FOR YOUR WORK TO ADVOCATE FOR OUR<br>
<br>
COMMUNITIES. >> THE REST I SUBMIT THANK YOU<br>
<br>
SUPERVISOR FIELDER SUPERVISOR MAHMUT THANK YOU COLLEAGUES.<br>
<br>
>> TODAY I'M PROUD TO PUT FORWARD A NEW ORDINANCE RELATED<br>
<br>
TO BUILDING PERMITS THAT IS PART OF A BROADER EFFORT TO<br>
<br>
MODERNIZE OUR BUILDING CODES AND ACCELERATE HOUSING AND SMALL BUSINESS PROJECTS ACROSS SAN FRANCISCO.<br>
<br>
>> OVER THE LAST SEVERAL MONTHS WE'VE HEARD FROM HOMEOWNERS,<br>
<br>
SMALL BUSINESSES AND DEVELOPERS ALIKE AND IT'S CLEAR OUR<br>
<br>
CURRENT PERMIT RULES SLOW DOWN PROGRESS, RAISE COSTS<br>
<br>
AND DISCOURAGE PEOPLE FROM MOVING FORWARD ON CRITICAL<br>
<br>
PROJECTS. THIS ORDINANCE IS A SIMPLE BUT POWERFUL STEP TOWARDS BRINGING GREATER CLARITY, ACCOUNTABILITY<br>
<br>
AND MOMENTUM TO OUR PERMITTING SYSTEM.<br>
<br>
>> MORE SPECIFICALLY, THIS ORDINANCE.<br>
<br>
THIS ORDINANCE MODERNIZES SAN FRANCISCO'S BUILDING PERMIT TIMELINES TO REDUCE ADMINISTRATIVE BURDEN, ALIGN<br>
<br>
WITH STATE CODE AND MAKE OUR PROCESSES MORE CONSISTENT WITH<br>
<br>
OTHER MAJOR JURISDICTIONS. >> UNDER CURRENT LAW, ISSUED<br>
<br>
PERMITS EXPIRE AFTER JUST 12 MONTHS FOR SMALLER PROJECTS<br>
<br>
AND 48 MONTHS FOR LARGER PROJECTS. >> REGARDLESS OF HOW MUCH PROGRESS IS BEING MADE, THIS<br>
<br>
MEANS THAT IF THERE ARE SUPPLY CHAIN ISSUES, UNEXPECTED<br>
<br>
OBSTACLES OR OTHER LIMITATIONS ON THE PACE OF A PROJECT,<br>
<br>
BUILDERS NEED TO APPLY FOR AN EXTENSION. >> THIS ADDS UNNECESSARY COSTS TO PROJECTS AND UNNECESSARY<br>
<br>
WORK FOR A DEPARTMENT OF BUILDING INSPECTION.<br>
<br>
>> THE PERMIT TIMELINES ARE ALSO BASED ON THE ESTIMATED<br>
<br>
VALUE OF CONSTRUCTION. A UNIQUELY SAN FRANCISCO APPROACH THAT ADDS COMPLEXITY AND CONFUSION FOR APPLICANTS<br>
<br>
ESPECIALLY THOSE WORKING ACROSS MULTIPLE CITIES.<br>
<br>
>> THIS LEGISLATION REPLACES A RIGID VALUATION BASED TIMELINE<br>
<br>
WITH A CLEAR CONSISTENT STANDARD ISSUED PERMITS EXPIRE<br>
<br>
365 DAYS AFTER ISSUANCE. BUT AS LONG AS THERE ARE INSPECTIONS OR LOGGED ACTIVITY WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF BUILDING<br>
<br>
INSPECTION, THE TIMELINE AUTOMAT LIKELY RESETS.<br>
<br>
>> CRUCIALLY, THIS APPROACH ALLOWS BUILDERS TO KEEP<br>
<br>
PROJECTS ACTIVE AS LONG AS THEY ARE PROGRESSING EVEN IF<br>
<br>
CONSTRUCTION IS SLOW OR INTERMITTENT. AS IS OFTEN THE CASE FOR SMALLER PROJECTS LIKE KITCHEN<br>
<br>
REMODELS OR FOR LARGER MULTI-PHASE HOUSING DEVELOPMENTS, RENEWAL FEES AND EXTENSION PAPERWORK ARE NO<br>
<br>
LONGER REQUIRED UNLESS A PROJECT HAS BEEN COMPLETELY<br>
<br>
INACTIVE FOR A FULL YEAR HELPING REDUCE UNNECESSARY<br>
<br>
COSTS AND DELAYS BY ALIGNING OUR PERMIT EXPIRATION RULES<br>
<br>
WITH THOSE OF THE STATE AND OTHER LARGE CALIFORNIA<br>
<br>
CITIES. THIS LEGISLATION SIMPLIFIES THE<br>
<br>
PROCESS FOR DEVELOPERS, HOMEOWNERS AND CONTRACTORS NAVIGATING MULTIPLE JURISDICTIONS.<br>
<br>
>> IN SHORT, THIS ORDINANCE HELPS REDUCE ADMINISTRATIVE<br>
<br>
BURDEN, LOWERS COSTS AND GIVES CERTAINTY TO THOSE TRYING TO<br>
<br>
BUILD IN OUR CITY WHETHER IT'S A HOUSING DEVELOPMENT OR A TENANT IMPROVEMENT TO A COMMERCIAL SPACE.<br>
<br>
I WANT TO THANK HANNAH AT THE DEPARTMENT OF BUILDING<br>
<br>
INSPECTION AND PETER LYNCH, OUR DRAFTING ATTORNEY FOR THEIR<br>
<br>
TECHNICAL WORK IN HELPING SHAPE THIS ORDINANCE. >> AND I WANT TO ESPECIALLY THANK SUPERVISOR DORSEY AND HIS<br>
<br>
LEGISLATIVE AIDE AND LAND USE SUPERSTAR MADISON TIM AND HIS<br>
<br>
OFFICE FOR THEIR EARLY WORK ON THIS LEGISLATION AND PARTNERING<br>
<br>
AND CO-SPONSORING AS WELL. >> THIS ORDINANCE WILL HELP US<br>
<br>
STREAMLINE PERMITTING, REDUCE BUREAUCRACY AND MAKE OUR CITY<br>
<br>
WORK BETTER FOR ALL THOSE TRYING TO BUILD IN IT. THE REST I SUBMIT. >> THANK YOU.<br>
<br>
SUPERVISOR MOMENT SUPERVISOR RANDLEMAN.<br>
<br>
>> THANK YOU MADAM CLERK. TODAY I HAVE AN ORDINANCE<br>
<br>
AND 17 RESOLUTIONS ALTHOUGH NOT TO WORRY 16 OF THEM ARE REALLY THE SAME THING ON THE ORDINANCE.<br>
<br>
I AM INTRODUCING LEGISLATION TO ESTABLISH AN ARTIST HOUSING<br>

<br>
A 1687 MARKET STREET PROJECT WHICH WILL PROVIDE MORE THAN 90<br>
<br>
AFFORDABLE APARTMENTS AND CREATIVE SPACES FOR ARTISTS INCLUDING REHEARSAL SPACES AND A BLACK BOX THEATER.<br>
<br>
>> THE DEVELOPMENT OF THIS PROJECT IS HIGHLIGHTED THE NEED<br>
<br>
FOR A FORMAL PROCESS BY WHICH TO IDENTIFY ARTISTS WHO MAY<br>
<br>
QUALIFY FOR THIS OR WHAT WE HOPE WILL BE FUTURE AFFORDABLE<br>
<br>
ARTIST HOUSING DEVELOPMENTS. THE ARTIST HOUSING CERTIFICATION PROGRAM WILL MEET THAT NEED FOR 1687 MARKET<br>
<br>

<br>
THAT I AM INTRODUCING ARE RELATE TO THE INITIATION OF<br>
<br>
LANDMARK DESIGNATION FOR 16 BUILDINGS ACROSS DISTRICT<br>
<br>
EIGHT. THE PACKAGE REPRESENTS A FIRST<br>
<br>
STEP TOWARD A MORE COMPREHENSIVE LOOK AT THE BUILT ENVIRONMENT IN DISTRICT EIGHT. WE KNOW THAT SAN FRANCISCO HAS<br>
<br>
RELATIVELY FEW LOCAL LANDMARKS AS WE MOVE AS WE REMOVE<br>
<br>
CONSTRAINTS ON HOUSING AND UP SO NEIGHBORHOODS TO ALLOW MORE<br>
<br>
DENSITY. WE NEED TO ENSURE THAT WHAT'S LEFT STANDING STILL TELLS THE STORY OF WHAT WE'VE BEEN.<br>

<br>
IS ONE TO ADD THE COMMEMORATIVE STREET NAME JIM MARSHALL WAY TO<br>
<br>

<br>
MOVEMENT FROM ITS BEAT GENERATION ROOTS IN NORTH BEACH TO THE CULMINATION OF THE SUMMER OF LOVE<br>

<br>
AND EUROPE. IT SEEMS ESPECIALLY FITTING TO<br>
<br>
BE RECOGNIZING JIM MARSHALL AS WE ENTER A DEAD SUMMER AS HE CAPTURED THOUSANDS OF GRATEFUL DEAD PHOTOS AND HIS CHRONICLING<br>
<br>
OF THE BAND BETWEEN 1966 AND 1977 WAS RECENTLY PUBLISHED<br>
<br>
IN GRATEFUL DEAD BY JIM MARSHALL. I WANT TO THANK MARSHALL'S LONGTIME FRIEND AND ASSISTANT<br>

<br>
THANK YOU, MR. PRESIDENT. YOUR USE OF THE WORD EPICENTER<br>
<br>
AT THIS TIME SINCE THOSE 2.0 EARTHQUAKES.<br>
<br>
>> OH DEAR. OOPS.<br>
<br>
>> NOT LOST ON ME. ALL RIGHT. THANK YOU. SUPERVISOR MELGAR.<br>
<br>
>> THANK YOU, MADAM CLERK. COLLEAGUES TODAY I AM<br>
<br>
INTRODUCING THE SAN FRANCISCO STREET SAFETY ACT A<br>
<br>
COMPREHENSIVE INTER-AGENCY LEGISLATION TO ADDRESS ONE OF<br>
<br>
THE MOST URGENT AND PREVENTABLE PUBLIC HEALTH CRISES IN OUR<br>
<br>
CITY WHICH IS TRAFFIC VIOLENCE. >> EVERY YEAR TRAFFIC CRASHES<br>
<br>
KILL OR SERIOUSLY INJURED DOZENS OF SAN FRANCISCANS<br>
<br>
PARTICULARLY CHILDREN. ELDERS, PEDESTRIANS AND LOW<br>
<br>
INCOME PEOPLE. DESPITE OUR LONG STANDING<br>
<br>
COMMITMENT TO VISION ZERO, THE RATE OF TRAFFIC FATALITIES IN SAN FRANCISCO HAS REMAINED LARGELY UNCHANGED.<br>
<br>
WE CANNOT AFFORD TO KEEP DOING THE SAME THING AND EXPECTING DIFFERENT RESULTS. ACCORDING TO A 2025 REPORT THAT<br>
<br>
I COMMISSIONED FROM OUR BUDGET AND LEGISLATIVE ANALYST TRAFFIC<br>
<br>
RELATED DEATHS AND INJURIES COST THE FRANCISCANS NEARLY<br>
<br>
$500 MILLION EVERY YEAR. NOT TO MENTION THE IMMEASURABLE<br>
<br>
PAIN AND LOSS EXPERIENCED BY FAMILIES IN VICTIMS.<br>
<br>
WE NOW HAVE A DECADE OF DATA SHOWING WHAT WE'RE THAT WHEN WE<br>
<br>
REDESIGN STREETS CRASHES DROP. BUT TOO OFTEN IMPLEMENTATION IS<br>
<br>
TOO SLOW TO REACT OR SILOED ACROSS AGENCIES.<br>
<br>
>> THIS RESOLUTION IS A CALL TO ACTION AND A ACCOUNT AND A CALL<br>
<br>
FOR ACCOUNTABILITY. IT DIRECTS DEPARTMENTS THE SFO<br>
<br>
TO THE SAN FRANCISCO POLICE DEPARTMENT, DEPARTMENT OF<br>
<br>
PUBLIC HEALTH, PUBLIC WORKS, THE FIRE DEPARTMENT AND THE<br>
<br>
SCHOOL DISTRICT TO TAKE CLEAR MEASURABLE STEPS TO MAKE OUR<br>
<br>
STREETS SAFER. BASED ON DATA BASED ON WHAT WE<br>
<br>
KNOW, BASED ON WHAT WE HAVE SEEN.<br>
<br>
THAT INCLUDES EXPANDING DAYLIGHTING. DEPLOYING RED LIGHTS AND SPEED CAMERAS WITHIN STATE LIMITS.<br>
<br>
INTEGRATING STREET SAFETY INTO REPAVING PROJECTS AS WE SHOULD<br>
<br>
BE DOING ALREADY. AND PUBLISHING A CITYWIDE<br>
<br>
DASHBOARD SO THAT THE PUBLIC CAN TRACK PROGRESS.<br>
<br>
WE KNOW THAT SPEEDING IS THE LEADING CAUSE OF FATAL CRASHES<br>
<br>
IN SAN FRANCISCO AND WE KNOW THAT RESIDENTS IN LOW INCOME NEIGHBORHOODS AND PARTICULARLY IN COMMUNITIES OF COLOR ARE<br>
<br>
DISPROPORTIONATELY AFFECTED BY UNSAFE CONDITIONS.<br>
<br>
THIS RESOLUTION CENTERS VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES AND USES<br>
<br>
DATA DRIVEN APPROACH TO TARGET THE MOST DANGEROUS STREETS WITH<br>
<br>
A FOCUS ON CHILDREN. SENIORS AND PEOPLE WITH<br>
<br>
DISABILITIES. THE SAN FRANCISCO STREET SAFETY<br>
<br>
ACT IS NOT JUST A POLICY SOLUTION IT'S ALSO A RECOMMITMENT TO MAKING SAFETY THE DEFAULT NOT THE EXCEPTION.<br>
<br>
AND CALLS FOR ACCOUNTABILITY REGULAR REPORTING IN FRONT OF<br>
<br>
US. AND IT WILL MAKE SURE THAT<br>
<br>
PEOPLE DO WHAT THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO BE DOING. I URGE MY COLLEAGUES TO JOIN ME IN SUPPORTING THIS EFFORT<br>
<br>
BECAUSE NO ONE SHOULD FEAR FOR THEIR LIFE SIMPLY CROSSING THE<br>
<br>
STREET IN OUR CITY. >> AND THE REST, MADAM CLERK.<br>
<br>
I SUBMIT. THANK YOU SUPERVISOR MELGAR.<br>
<br>
>> SUPERVISOR SAUTER. THANK YOU, MADAM CLERK.<br>
<br>
COLLEAGUES TODAY I HAVE TWO ITEMS TO INTRODUCE. FIRST, I AM SUBMITTING A LETTER OF INQUIRY TO THE SAN FRANCISCO<br>
<br>
POLICE DEPARTMENT TO EXAMINE THEIR APPROACH TO RECRUITING<br>
<br>
AND TRAINING NEW OFFICERS. IT IS MY HOPE THAT WE CAN<br>
<br>
IDENTIFY WAYS TO SUCCESSFULLY ACCELERATE THE PACE OF HIRING,<br>
<br>
TRAINING AND PLACING OFFICERS SO THAT THEY CAN BE READY TO SERVE OUR COMMUNITIES. I WANT TO START BY<br>
<br>
ACKNOWLEDGING THAT I BELIEVE REAL PROGRESS IS BEING MADE<br>
<br>
THROUGH MAYOR LURIE REBUILDING THE RANKS AN INITIATIVE WHICH I<br>
<br>
WAS AN EARLY SUPPORTER OF. IN ONE SAMPLE OF THAT EARLY SUCCESS FROM JANUARY TO JUNE 2025, S.F. PD HAS RECEIVED 2155<br>
<br>
APPLICATIONS WHICH IS A 64% INCREASE FROM 1311 1311 DURING<br>
<br>
THE SAME PERIOD IN 2024. BUT WITH A STAFFING SHORTAGE OF<br>
<br>
WELL OVER 500 OFFICERS, WE NEED TO KEEP PUSHING FOR MORE IMPROVEMENTS AT EVERY STEP OF THE PROCESS.<br>
<br>
SO SPECIFICALLY I AM ASKING FOR MORE INFORMATION ON OUR<br>
<br>
APPROACH TO LATERAL RECRUITMENT WHICH IS A PATHWAY THAT SEEMS PROMISING BUT MAY BE HELD BACK BY LOW PAY BONUSES COMPARED TO<br>
<br>
OTHER BAY AREA CITIES. I'M ALSO INTERESTED IN LEARNING<br>
<br>
ABOUT A POSSIBLE PARTNERSHIP WITH OUR LOCAL UNIVERSITIES<br>
<br>
SIMILAR TO THE LAW ENFORCEMENT CANDIDATE SCHOLARS PROGRAM AT<br>
<br>
SACRAMENTO STATE UNIVERSITY WHICH IS A PROGRAM THAT<br>
<br>
PREPARES UNDERGRADUATE STUDENTS FOR A CAREER IN LAW ENFORCEMENT<br>
<br>
. MY LETTER OF INQUIRY ALSO ASKS A SERIES OF QUESTIONS RELATED TO HOW WE CAN BETTER RECRUIT<br>
<br>
AND RETAIN FRONTLINE PERSONNEL WHO ARE BILINGUAL AND CAN SERVE<br>
<br>
OUR DIVERSE COMMUNITIES. I BELIEVE WE MUST COMMIT TO<br>
<br>
IMPROVING THIS SKILL SET ACROSS EVERY DEPARTMENT ESPECIALLY OUR<br>
<br>
FRONTLINE PUBLIC SAFETY AGENCIES.<br>
<br>
I ALSO HAVE A HEARING REQUEST TO INTRODUCE TODAY JUST A FEW<br>
<br>
WEEKS AGO I SAT IN THESE SAME CHAMBERS WITH SUPERVISOR WALTON<br>
<br>
FIELDER AND CHERYL FOR A HEARING ON THE IMPLOSION OF THE SAN FRANCISCO PARKS ALLIANCE. >> WHAT WE LEARNED SHOULD BE OF<br>
<br>
GREAT CONCERN. A COMPLETE MISMANAGEMENT OF<br>
<br>
MONEY, A TOTAL LACK OF RESPONSIBILITY AND AT LEAST<br>
<br>
$5.8 MILLION MISSING THAT BELONGS TO COMMUNITY GROUPS.<br>
<br>
TO BE VERY CLEAR, I BELIEVE THESE ISSUES LAY SQUARELY AT<br>
<br>
THE FAULT OF THE PARKS ALLIANCE AND LIKELY A FEW INDIVIDUALS IN LEADERSHIP. BUT IT DOES BRING TO MIND THE<br>
<br>
BROADER QUESTION OF HOW OUR CITY ENGAGES WITH PARTNERS<br>
<br>
IN NONPROFITS. AND IF THERE IS ANY MECHANISM<br>
<br>
THAT WE COULD HAVE USED TO SPOT WARNING SIGNS EARLIER FOR THIS<br>
<br>
EXACT PURPOSE, OUR CITY'S COMPTROLLER OFFICE OVERSEES A<br>
<br>
NONPROFIT MONITORING AND CAPACITY BUILDING PROGRAM.<br>
<br>
THIS PROGRAM IS LONG STANDING HAVING BEGUN IN 2005.<br>
<br>
SINCE THEN A 2024 ORDINANCE CHAMPIONED BY NOW<br>
<br>
ASSEMBLYMEMBER STEFANI ADDED A NEW ADDED NEW LEGISLATIVE<br>
<br>
REQUIREMENTS AND REPORTING STANDARDS TO THIS PROGRAM.<br>
<br>
OVER 700 NONPROFIT ORGANIZATIONS ARE CONTRACTED TO<br>
<br>
WORK WITH THE SAN FRANCISCO GOVERNMENT AND THESE ORGANIZATIONS DELIVER MORE THAN $1.5 BILLION IN SERVICES EACH<br>
<br>
YEAR. WHILE 69% OF THE CITY'S<br>
<br>
CONTRACTORS ENDED THE MOST RECENT OVERSIGHT CYCLE WITH<br>
<br>
FULL COMPLIANCE, THE OTHER 31% FACE CHALLENGES WITH PRODUCING<br>
<br>
AUDITED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND AGENCY WIDE BUDGETS.<br>
<br>
SO IN OUR HEARING WE INTEND TO ASK FOR UPDATES ON THE MOST<br>
<br>
RECENT OVERSIGHT AND REPORTING REQUIREMENT CHANGES FROM THE<br>
<br>
2024 UPDATE AND DIG INTO WAYS THAT WE CAN BETTER WORK WITH<br>
<br>
NONPROFIT PARTNERS TO DELIVER EFFECTIVE SERVICES WHILE<br>
<br>
MINIMIZING WASTE AND FISCAL MISMANAGEMENT AND THE REST OF<br>
<br>
IT. >> THANK YOU SUPERVISOR SAUTER<br>
<br>
SUPERVISOR SHERYL. SUBMIT THANK YOU. SUPERVISOR WALTON. >> THANK YOU SO MUCH, MADAM<br>
<br>
CHAIR. COLLEAGUES TODAY I'M<br>
<br>
INTRODUCING AN ORDINANCE FOR THE SAN FRANCISCO FIRE<br>
<br>
DEPARTMENT TO CONSTRUCT A NEW TRAINING FACILITY FOR THE<br>
<br>
DEPARTMENT EMPLOYEES AT 1236 CARROLL.<br>
<br>
THIS FACILITY WILL CONSOLIDATE AND REPLACE THE CURRENT TRAINING FACILITIES ON TREASURE ISLAND AND IN THE MISSION<br>
<br>
DISTRICT IN ORDER TO BUILD THE FACILITY.<br>
<br>
SEVERAL UNACCEPTABLE STREETS NEED TO BE VACATED.<br>
<br>
PUBLIC WORKS HAS PERFORMED THE NECESSARY STEPS FOR A STREET<br>
<br>
VACATION. THERE ARE PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION AND PGE ANY UTILITIES IN THE VACATION AREA<br>
<br>
AND THEIR RESPECTIVE ACCESS TO THOSE FACILITIES IS<br>
<br>
INCORPORATED INTO THE LEGISLATION OF ATTACHED TO THE<br>
<br>
PROJECT SITE LAYOUT. >> FOR REFERENCE TODAY'S<br>
<br>
LEGISLATION INCLUDES A RESOLUTION OF INTENT ALONG WITH<br>
<br>
THE ORDINANCE FOR STREET VACATION AND THE ORDINANCE FOR<br>
<br>
THE PLANNING CODE UPDATE. THIS PROJECT IS FUNDED BY THE<br>
<br>
VOTER APPROVED EARTHQUAKE SAFETY AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE<br>
<br>
ALSO KNOWN AS THE EASTER BOND MEASURE FROM 2020.<br>
<br>
PUBLIC WORKS HAS MET WITH SEVERAL NEIGHBORHOOD GROUPS TO<br>
<br>
PROVIDE AN OVERVIEW OF THE PROJECT AND TO SOLICIT INPUT<br>
<br>
INCLUDING THE BABY HUNTERS POINT CITIZENS ADVISORY<br>
<br>
COMMITTEE. BELLEVUE HILL NEIGHBORHOOD ASSOCIATION TRUE HOPE CHURCH AND ALICE GRIFFITH TENANTS<br>
<br>
ASSOCIATION COUNCIL. I WANT TO THANK IAN SNYDER FROM<br>
<br>
PUBLIC WORKS AND DCA CHRIS TOM FOR PUTTING THIS TOGETHER<br>
<br>
AND THANK YOU TO THE SAN FRANCISCO FIRE DEPARTMENT FOR BRINGING THIS FACILITY AND THE IMPROVEMENTS THAT COME WITH IT<br>
<br>
TO DISTRICT TEN. >> I'M ALSO INTRODUCING AN AMENDMENT TO THE LEASE WITH THE YMCA FOR BUILDING 49 AT CRANE<br>
<br>
COVE PARK WITH THE PORT TO HELP COVER UNEXPECTED COSTS FROM<br>
<br>
CRITICAL STRUCTURAL REPAIRS. THIS AMENDMENT PROVIDES<br>
<br>
$150,000 IN ADDITIONAL RENT CREDITS AND PROTECTS $6,000<br>
<br>
IN CREDITS FOR MAINTAINING PUBLIC RESTROOMS.<br>
<br>
THE NEW DOGPATCH YMCA OFFICIALLY OPENED THEIR DOORS THIS YEAR AND IS ALREADY DELIVERING ON ITS PROMISE TO<br>
<br>
SERVE THE COMMUNITY. THIS SMALL BUT IMPORTANT<br>
<br>
ADJUSTMENT HELPS ENSURE THE PROJECT STAYS FINALLY<br>
<br>
FINANCIALLY SUSTAINABLE WHILE CONTINUING TO PROVIDE PUBLIC<br>
<br>
BENEFITS. >> AND LAST I HAVE A RESOLUTION<br>
<br>
TO RECOGNIZE AUGUST 20TH, 25 AS BLACK BUSINESS MONTH HERE<br>
<br>
IN SAN FRANCISCO. >> HONORING THE 22ND ANNUAL<br>
<br>
NATIONAL BLACK BUSINESS MONTH FOUNDED BY SAN FRANCISCAN<br>
<br>
FREDERICK E JORDAN SENIOR AND HISTORIAN JOHN WILLIAMS<br>
<br>
TEMPLETON THIS MONTH UPLIFTS THE LEGACY AND IMPACT OF BLACK<br>
<br>
ENTREPRENEURS BOTH PAST AND PRESENT.<br>
<br>
IT HONORS PIONEERS LIKE CAPTAIN WILLIAM ALEXANDER LASTER OFF A<br>
<br>
BLACK MARINA AND ONE OF SAN FRANCISCO'S FIRST MAJOR<br>
<br>
ENTREPRENEURS WHO HELPED SHAPE THE CITY'S EARLY ECONOMY<br>

AND SERVED AS ITS FIRST TREASURER IN THE 1840S.<br>
<br>
FROM TRAILBLAZERS LIKE HIM TO TODAY'S THRIVING BLACK<br>

<br>
TEN SUCH AS GUMBO SOCIAL YVONNE SWEETS PUMPKINS ONE STOP BEAUTY<br>
<br>
SHOP SMOKE SOUL KITCHEN AND MORE.<br>
<br>
BLACK OWNED BUSINESSES ARE ESSENTIAL TO SAN FRANCISCO'S CULTURE AND ECONOMIC LIFE. THIS RESOLUTION CALLS ON THE<br>
<br>
CITY TO DEEPEN ITS INVESTMENT IN EQUITABLE ECONOMIC<br>
<br>
DEVELOPMENT AND UPLIFT BLACK BUSINESSES YEAR ROUND.<br>
<br>
I'D LIKE TO GIVE A SPECIAL THANK TO SPECIAL THANK YOU TO OUR SUMMER INTERN EZRA MERCER, A RECENT HOWARD GRADUATE FOR<br>
<br>
WORKING ALONGSIDE MY CHIEF OF STAFF NOW LED ON THIS RESOLUTION. I ALSO WANT TO SHOUT OUT OUR<br>
<br>
TWO INCREDIBLE YEAR ROUND INTERNS DAMIAN ROCHELLE, A<br>
<br>
SENIOR AT SAN FRANCISCO STATE WHO'S BEEN WITH US SINCE<br>
<br>
JANUARY AND CARL LEVI, A RECENT UNIVERSITY OF SAN FRANCISCO<br>
<br>
GRADUATE WHO ALSO JOINED US IN JANUARY. WE'RE SO GRATEFUL FOR THEIR DEDICATION AND CONTRIBUTIONS TO<br>
<br>
THE DISTRICT TEN DREAM TEAM THIS YEAR. THE REST I SUBMIT. THANK YOU.<br>
<br>
SUPERVISOR WALTON. SUPERVISOR CHIN CHAN SUBMITS.<br>
<br>
THANK YOU. SUPERVISOR CHEN SUBMIT.<br>
<br>
>> THANK YOU. AND SUPERVISOR DORSEY. THANK YOU, MADAM CLERK. COLLEAGUES, LET'S SAY SORRY<br>
<br>
ABOUT THIS, OKAY? >> I HAVE A BLUE REQUEST AND IN<br>
<br>
MEMORIAM FIRST TIME TODAY SUBMITTING A REQUEST TO OUR<br>
<br>
BUDGET AND LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE TO ESTIMATE<br>
<br>
THE COST TO SAN FRANCISCO TAXPAYERS FOR PROVISIONS OF OUR EQUAL BENEFITS ORDINANCE WHICH MANDATES DOMESTIC PARTNER<br>
<br>
BENEFITS THAT WERE ONCE BUT NO LONGER THE ONLY CHANCE GAY<br>
<br>
AND LESBIAN COUPLES HAD FOR EQUAL EMPLOYMENT BENEFITS.<br>
<br>
TODAY SAME SEX MARRIAGE IS THE LAW OF THE LAND, OF COURSE,<br>
<br>
AND IT HAS BEEN FOR THE LAST DECADE. YET SAN FRANCISCO STILL PROHIBITS WHAT IS NOW A GROWING<br>
<br>
MAJORITY OF BUSINESSES FROM EVEN COMPETING FOR ANY OF OUR<br>
<br>
$5.8 BILLION IN TAXPAYER FUNDED CONTRACTS FOR GOODS<br>
<br>
AND SERVICES ANNUALLY. THE REASON IS THAT THEY DON'T<br>
<br>
PROVIDE ADEQUATE DOMESTIC PARTNER BENEFITS. MY REQUEST TODAY POSES THREE QUESTIONS FOR THE BLR TO<br>
<br>
RESEARCH. FIRST, WHAT IS THE MOST<br>
<br>
RELIABLE ESTIMATE OF THE PERCENTAGE OF ALL U.S.<br>
<br>
BUSINESSES THAT STILL OFFER THEIR EMPLOYEES DOMESTIC PARTNERSHIP BENEFITS EQUAL TO THOSE THEY PROVIDE TO MARRIED<br>
<br>
COUPLES? SINCE SAME SEX MARRIAGE RIGHTS<br>
<br>
WERE FIRST SECURED NATIONWIDE BY THE U.S. SUPREME COURT'S<br>
<br>
DECISION IN OBERGEFELL VERSUS HODGES IN 2015.<br>
<br>
TWO. ASSUMING THE ACCURACY OF DATA'S DATA, MY OFFICE IDENTIFIED SHOWING THAT NO MORE THAN 45%<br>
<br>
OF LARGE BUSINESSES NATIONWIDE TODAY EVEN OFFER DOMESTIC<br>
<br>
PARTNER BENEFITS WITH NO ESTIMATES FOR SMALL OR MEDIUM<br>
<br>
SIZED BENEFITS FOR BUSINESSES. WHAT COST SAVINGS MIGHT SAN<br>
<br>
FRANCISCO REASONABLY EXPECT WERE WE TO OPEN COMPETITIVE<br>
<br>
BIDDING FOR CITY CONTRACTS TO 100% OF BUSINESSES RATHER THAN<br>
<br>
JUST 45%? AND THREE WHAT ARE THE ACTUAL DIRECT COSTS TO SAN FRANCISCO TAXPAYERS FOR ENFORCEMENT<br>
<br>
AND COMPLIANCE OF EQUAL BENEFITS PROVISIONS BY THE<br>
<br>
OFFICE OF CONTRACT ADMINISTRATION CITY ATTORNEY'S<br>
<br>
OFFICE AND OTHER DEPARTMENTS? I'M ASKING THAT THIS INCLUDE AN ACCOUNTING FOR COSTS TO PROCESS WAIVERS AND FROM THESE<br>
<br>
REQUIREMENTS AS WELL. NOW THERE ADMITTEDLY WAS A TIME<br>
<br>
BEFORE SAME SEX MARRIAGE RIGHTS WERE SECURED NATIONWIDE WHEN<br>
<br>
SUCH A BIDDING PROHIBITION MADE SENSE.<br>
<br>
FOR YEARS DOMESTIC PARTNERSHIPS REFLECTED THE HOLY WORTHWHILE<br>
<br>
PRINCIPLE OF LGBTQ PLUS EQUALITY AND THAT PRINCIPLE WAS<br>
<br>
WORTH THE ADDED EXPENSE BORNE BY TAXPAYERS IN SAN FRANCISCO.<br>
<br>
TODAY'S EQUAL BENEFITS ORDINANCE, HOWEVER, IS NO LONGER AN LGBTQ PLUS ISSUE THAT IS INARGUABLE.<br>
<br>
AND IT HASN'T BEEN AN LGBTQ PLUS ISSUE SINCE 2015.<br>
<br>
BY MAKING COMPETITIVE BIDDING MORE COMPETITIVE SAN FRANCISCO<br>
<br>
CAN DERIVE GREATER VALUE FOR THE GOODS AND SERVICES WE<br>
<br>
PURCHASE WITH OUR TAXPAYERS DOLLARS.<br>
<br>
>> IT CERTAINLY SEEMS PLAUSIBLE THAT EXPANDING OUR BIDDING<br>
<br>
ELIGIBILITY FROM FEWER THAN 45% OF BUSINESSES TO FULLY 100% OF<br>
<br>
BUSINESSES WOULD ACHIEVE SOME MEASURE OF SAVINGS FOR THE MORE<br>
<br>
ROBUST COMPETITION. GIVEN PUBLISHED RESEARCH SHOWING THAT SAN FRANCISCO'S ANNUAL EXPENDITURE FOR GOODS<br>
<br>
AND SERVICES CONTRACTS TOTALS $5.8 BILLION, EVEN A MARGINAL<br>
<br>
SAVINGS OF JUST 5% WOULD NET US $290 MILLION.<br>
<br>
AND FOR CONTEXT THAT IS MORE THAN THE ENTIRE BUDGET OF THE<br>
<br>
RECREATION AND PARK DEPARTMENT. BEFORE WE PUT PEN TO PAPER ON<br>
<br>
LEGISLATION OBVIOUSLY LET'S DO LET IT BE THOUGHTFUL ABOUT THIS<br>
<br>
LET'S ALLOW THE BLR TO DO ITS WORK. LET'S SEE WHAT KIND OF COST SAVINGS THEY ESTIMATE AND THEN<br>
<br>
LET'S LEGISLATE RESPONSIBLY AND PRUDENTLY.<br>
<br>
WE OWE SAN FRANCISCO TAXPAYERS NOTHING LESS.<br>
<br>
>> AND NEXT. COLLEAGUES I ASK THAT WE<br>
<br>
ADJOURN TODAY'S MEETING IN REMEMBRANCE OF SCOTT GARVEY<br>
<br>
,A DEEPLY COMPASSIONATE, CREATIVE AND LOVING SOUL WHOSE TRAGIC RECENT DEATH HAS LEFT HIS FAMILY AND MANY OTHERS<br>
<br>
REELING INCLUDING FRIENDS AND LOVED ONES HERE IN SAN<br>
<br>
FRANCISCO. I GREW UP AS A CLOSE FRIEND OF<br>
<br>
THE GARVEY'S AND I KNOW I'VE KNOWN THEM WELL MOST OF MY LIFE<br>
<br>
. SCOTT ATTENDED ST MARY'S CATHOLIC SCHOOL IN WESTFIELD, MASSACHUSETTS WITH HIS OLDER<br>
<br>
BROTHER AND ME AND IT WAS PERHAPS THERE THAT SCOTT<br>
<br>
DEVELOPED HIS COMMITMENT TO SOCIAL JUSTICE WHICH IN HIS LIFE WOULD BECOME HIS MOST ADMIRED TRAIT.<br>
<br>
SCOTT WAS A POET, A MUSICIAN AND ABOVE ALL A GIVER SOMEONE<br>
<br>
WHO CARRIED THE BURDEN OF AN OUTSIZED HEART IN A WORLD THAT<br>
<br>
TOO OFTEN SHUNS THOSE WHO STRUGGLE. ALTHOUGH HE FACED MENTAL HEALTH CHALLENGES MOST OF HIS ADULT<br>
<br>
LIFE HAVING BEEN DIAGNOSED WITH SCHIZOPHRENIA AND BIPOLAR<br>
<br>
DISORDER, SCOTT'S GENEROUS SPIRIT AND HIS GOOD HEART WERE<br>
<br>
UNDIMINISHED. HE FOUND PURPOSE IN OFFERING COMFORT AND CARE TO OTHERS IN NEED AND HE WOULD OFTEN USE<br>
<br>
WHATEVER DISCRETIONARY FUNDS HE HAD FROM HIS LIMITED DISABILITY<br>
<br>
INCOME TO HELP OTHERS TO BUY CLEAN SOCKS OR WARM GLOVES OR<br>
<br>
MEALS TO SHARE WITH UNHOUSED NEIGHBORS.<br>
<br>
FOR SCOTT IT WASN'T PERFORMATIVE. IT WAS WHO HE WAS. HIS IMPULSE TO HELP AND TO GIVE<br>
<br>
BACK JUST CAME NATURALLY TO HIM. THE FAMILY MEMBERS AND FRIENDS. SCOTT'S EMPATHY WAS RADIANT.<br>
<br>
FRIENDS DESCRIBED HIM AS SOFT SPOKEN AND POETIC SOMEONE WHO<br>
<br>
LISTENED MORE THAN HE SPOKE AND WHO HAD THE RARE GIFT OF MAKING OTHERS FEEL TRULY SEEN. HIS ART ESPECIALLY HIS POETRY<br>
<br>
AND HIS DRUMMING WAS AN EXTENSION OF HIS EMOTIONAL<br>
<br>
GENEROSITY. LIKE MANY ARTISTS, HE COULD<br>
<br>
FIND MEANING IN PAIN AND CREATE BEAUTY OUT OF STRUGGLE.<br>
<br>
SAN FRANCISCO HELD A VERY SPECIAL PLACE IN SCOTT'S HEART FOR A TIME. MANY YEARS AGO HE LIVED IN OUR<br>
<br>
CITY'S STORIED HAIGHT-ASHBURY NEIGHBORHOOD WHICH WAS<br>
<br>
ESPECIALLY MEANINGFUL TO HIM AS A TALENTED MUSICIAN HIMSELF.<br>
<br>
WHEN HE MOVED TO VERMONT EARLIER THIS YEAR ALONG WITH HIS MOTHER JUDY OR MAMA J AS SHE'S AFFECTIONATELY<br>
<br>
AFFECTIONATELY KNOWN, HE WANTED TO BE CLOSER TO HIS SISTER<br>
<br>
KARA. IT WAS WITH THE HOPE OF<br>
<br>
ACCESSING BETTER CARE IN THE REGION HE GREW UP THAT HE COULD CONTINUE TO CONTINUE ON HIS PATH OF HEALING.<br>
<br>
SADLY HE SCARCELY HAD THE CHANCE.<br>
<br>
EARLIER THIS MONTH IN THE MIDST OF A MENTAL HEALTH CRISIS,<br>
<br>
SCOTT LOST HIS LIFE WHEN HE WAS SHOT IN AN ENCOUNTER WITH A VERMONT STATE POLICE TROOPER. UNARMED AT THE TIME.<br>
<br>
HIS FAMILY IS NOW LEFT TO GRAPPLE WITH UNIMAGINABLE GRIEF<br>
<br>
. THEY ARE BOTH HAUNTED BY KNOWLEDGE OF COMPASSION AND GRACE. SCOTT WASN'T EXTENDED IN HIS LAST MOMENTS WHEN HE NEEDED IT<br>
<br>
MOST. THERE ALSO HUMBLED BY THE LOVE<br>
<br>
AND KINDNESS OF FRIENDS AND FAMILY MEMBERS EVEN<br>
<br>
NEIGHBORS AND STRANGERS IN THE COMMUNITY IN PUTNEY, VERMONT<br>
<br>
WHO HAVE BEEN MOVED TO HELP THE GARVEY FAMILY AND TO HEAL.<br>
<br>
IN REMEMBERING SCOTT TODAY, HIS FAMILY ASKS THAT WE DO NOT SOLELY MOURN BUT ALSO TAKE IT AS A CALL TO CONSCIENCE<br>
<br>
AND THAT WE CARRY SCOTT'S SPIRIT OF SOCIAL JUSTICE<br>
<br>
AND HOW WE LEAD IN THE POLICIES WE PASSED AND HOW WE CARE FOR<br>
<br>
OUR OWN MOST VULNERABLE AND HOW WE ENCOUNTER THOSE<br>
<br>
IN BEHAVIORAL CRISES AND IN THE HOPES WE HOLD FOR A BETTER WORLD. REST IN PEACE SCOTT.<br>
<br>
MAY MEMORY BE A BLESSING AND A REMINDER OF WHAT WE NEED TO<br>
<br>
CHANGE AND THE REST I SUBMIT. >> THANK YOU SUPERVISOR DORSEY<br>
<br>

HELLO. WE ARE BARELY SIX MONTHS INTO<br>
<br>
THIS FEDERAL ADMINISTRATION AND LOCAL ONE TWO AND THINGS<br>
<br>
WILL ONLY GET WORSE. WE ARE BEING PUT TO THE TEST<br>
<br>
STARTING IN 2022 FOR REDISTRICTING IS WHEN I STARTED<br>
<br>
GETTING INVOLVED IN LOCAL GOVERNMENT MAKING MY VOICE KNOWN AS A CONSTITUENT. >> LATER I SPEARHEADED AND GOT<br>
<br>
UNANIMOUS UNANIMOUSLY PASSED A PROTECT TRANS AND LGBTQ YOUTH<br>
<br>
AND ADULTS RESOLUTION IN 2023 AND THEN THINGS GOT OUT OF MY<br>
<br>
CONTROL. BUT I CONTINUE TO BE JUST ME<br>
<br>
BECAUSE THAT'S ALL I KNOW REALLY HOW TO DO.<br>
<br>
I TRY TO UPLIFT THE VOICES OF THE IGNORED POINT OUT THE<br>
<br>
HYPOCRISY OF OUR GOVERNMENT, INFORM PEOPLE AND ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO CARE FOR OTHERS. I NEVER THOUGHT MYSELF AS A<br>
<br>
LEADER BUT IN THESE FASCIST TIMES I CAN'T DOWNPLAY MY WORDS<br>
<br>
AND ACTIONS ANYMORE BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE SCARED THERE'S LESS<br>
<br>
PEOPLE BEING LOUD AND CRITICAL AND DEFIANT DURING THESE DANGEROUS DAYS AND SO TO EVERY SCARED PERSON IN THIS BUILDING<br>
<br>
AND EVERY SCARED PERSON WATCHING KNOW THAT I AM SCARED<br>
<br>
TOO VERY SCARED. I DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH WORSE<br>
<br>
THINGS WILL GET NOR WHAT WILL HAPPEN TO ME AS A DEFIANT TRANS<br>
<br>
MEXICAN-AMERICAN. >> BUT I ALSO KNOW THAT I AM PROUD OF MYSELF, PROUD OF MY FRIENDS AND PROUD OF OUR<br>
<br>
COMMUNITY FOR NOT BOWING DOWN TO KISS ANY BILLIONAIRE'S RING<br>
<br>
FOR ACTING UP IN DEFENSE OF OUR IMMIGRANT FAMILIES IN DEFENSE<br>
<br>
OF PALESTINIAN SUFFERING, GENOCIDE AND DEFENSE OF HOMELESS PEOPLE IN DEFENSE OF PEOPLE WITH SUBSTANCE USE<br>
<br>
DISORDER FOR PERSISTING IN PRACTICING OUR MORALS OF<br>
<br>
TREATING OTHERS THE WAY YOU WANT TO BE TREATED FOR ACKNOWLEDGING THE HORRIBLE REVERBERATIONS OF THE GENOCIDE<br>
<br>
OF INDIGENOUS PEOPLE HERE AND THE KIDNAPING AND ENSLAVEMENT OF MILLIONS OF INDIGENOUS AFRICANS FOR NOT<br>
<br>
ABANDONING THE T AND LGBTQ PLUS AND FOR PROTECTING TRANS<br>
<br>
AND INTERSEX KIDS AND ADULTS WHO WANT NOTHING MORE BUT TO LIVE THEIR LIVES AS THEMSELVES FOR LISTENING AND HEEDING TO<br>
<br>
THE NEEDS OF DISABLED PEOPLE FOR NOT VILLAINIZING SEX<br>
<br>
WORKERS BUT WANTING TO GIVE THEIR WORK DIGNITY AND PROTECTION AND SO MUCH MORE SO MUCH MORE I CAN'T FIT HERE.<br>
<br>
AND IF ANY OF THIS SOUNDS LIKE YOU I AM PROUD OF YOU.<br>

<br>
GOOD EVENING SUPERVISORS. I'M JULIANNE MALONEY, CO-CEO OF<br>
<br>
SUTRO POWER, THE SAN FRANCISCO BASED GREEN ENERGY COMPANY<br>
<br>
AND I'M HERE REPRESENTING THE S.F. SOLAR AND STORAGE COALITION. THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION JUST<br>
<br>
ELIMINATED THE 30% SOLAR TAX CREDIT EFFECTIVE JANUARY 2026.<br>
<br>
THIS CREATES IMMEDIATE URGENCY AS THOUSANDS OF SAN FRANCISCANS<br>
<br>
ARE ATTEMPTING TO GET THEIR SYSTEMS DESIGNED, INSTALLED<br>
<br>
AND ACTIVATED BEFORE THE DEADLINE AS SAN FRANCISCANS<br>
<br>
RUSH TO GO SOLAR. OUR CITY'S PERMITTING PROCESSES<br>
<br>
ARE BLOCKING THEM PLAN REVIEWS TAKE WEEKS IF NOT MONTHS LONGER<br>
<br>
THAN NECESSARY. INSPECTIONS ARE ALSO MORE<br>
<br>
DIFFICULT WHERE IT ONCE TOOK A SINGLE WEEK FOR INSPECTION<br>
<br>
TURNAROUND IT IS NOW 3 TO 6 WEEKS TO GET FINALIZED.<br>
<br>
OUR INSTALLATIONS FACE ADDITIONAL RED TAPE ON MULTIFAMILY BUILDINGS, APARTMENTS AND COMMERCIAL<br>
<br>
SPACES AS THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION ATTACKS GREEN<br>
<br>
ENERGY, SAN FRANCISCO SHOULD MAKE IT EASIER FOR RESIDENTS TO<br>
<br>
CHOOSE CLEAN ENERGY, NOT HARDER .<br>
<br>
YOU'RE GOING TO HEAR FROM FRUSTRATED RESIDENTS WHOSE SOLAR INSTALLATIONS ARE DELAYED BY CURRENT PROCESSES.<br>
<br>
THIS ISN'T JUST ABOUT BEATING A FEDERAL DEADLINE.<br>
<br>
THE PERMITTING REFORMS WE NEED NOW WILL SERVE RESIDENTS FOR<br>
<br>
DECADES AS OUR CITY REQUIRES TENS OF THOUSANDS MORE SOLAR<br>
<br>
AND STORAGE INSTALLATIONS. SUPERVISORS INCLUDE OUR<br>
<br>
COALITION IN THESE POLICY DISCUSSIONS.<br>
<br>
WE ARE IN THE TRENCHES HERE. WE UNDERSTAND EXACTLY WHERE THE<br>
<br>
BOTTLENECKS ARE AND HOW TO FIX THEM.<br>
<br>
WHILE OTHER BAY AREA CITIES ARE STREAMLINING, SAN FRANCISCO<br>
<br>
SHOULDN'T FALL BEHIND USE THIS URGENT MOMENT TO PREPARE THE<br>
<br>
GREEN ENERGY INFRASTRUCTURE OUR CITY NEEDS.<br>
<br>
THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR YOUR COMMENTS.<br>
<br>
NEXT SPEAKER PLEASE. >> GOOD EVENING SUPERVISORS.<br>
<br>
I'M JOHN POWER UP AND REPRESENTING BOTH MY SOLAR<br>

AND LAST WEEK REGARDING MY COALITION'S PLATFORM. THANK YOU. SUPERVISORS FIELDER MELGAR<br>
<br>
SHORTER AND GARCIA MAHMOOD AND PRESIDENT RANDLEMAN FOR<br>
<br>
FOLLOWING UP AND ENGAGING WITH US.<br>
<br>
>> I CAME TODAY TO REQUEST THAT YOU CONVENE A SPECIAL SESSION<br>
<br>
OR COMMITTEE HEARING DEDICATED TO HEARING DIRECTLY FROM OUR<br>
<br>
COALITION ON URGENT MATTERS RELATED TO ROOFTOP SOLAR ENERGY<br>
<br>
EQUITY AND THE CITY'S DECARBONIZATION GOALS BEFORE<br>
<br>
FURTHER POLICY IS MADE BY DEVI YES A FIRE DEPARTMENT OR CLEAN<br>
<br>
POWER S.F.. WE BELIEVE THERE'S AN IMMEDIATE<br>
<br>
NEED FOR STRUCTURED DIALOG BETWEEN POLICYMAKERS AND FRONT<br>
<br>
LINE STAKEHOLDERS WORKING ON DISTRIBUTED ENERGY IN SAN FRANCISCO. WE'RE REQUESTING THAT A<br>
<br>
SUPERVISOR SPONSOR THE SESSION SO THAT WE MAY FORMALLY PRESENT<br>
<br>
DATA, TESTIMONY AND POLICY PROPOSALS THAT IMPACT THOUSANDS<br>
<br>
OF RESIDENTS AND SMALL BUSINESSES.<br>
<br>
THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. WE LOOK FORWARD TO COLLABORATING ON A SESSION THAT ADVANCES LOCAL CLIMATE<br>
<br>
LEADERSHIP AND ENERGY INDEPENDENCE.<br>
<br>
>> THANK YOU FOR YOUR COMMENTS. WELCOME TO THE NEXT SPEAKER.<br>
<br>
THANK YOU. MY NAME IS MARIANNE RODRIGUEZ<br>
<br>
GAVEL. I AM A RESIDENT AND EMPLOYEE<br>
<br>
IN DISTRICT FIVE CLEAN POWER S.F. WAS CREATED BY SAN<br>
<br>
FRANCISCANS TO GENERATE LOCAL ENERGY AND INCREASE OUR<br>
<br>
INDEPENDENCE. IT WAS CREATED TO MAKE POSSIBLE A PATH TO CLEAN LOCAL ENERGY WITHOUT THE WALL STREET GREED<br>
<br>
AND PROFIT FOCUSED INVESTOR OWNED UTILITIES LIKE P, G AND E<br>
<br>
NOW CLEAN POWER S.F. INTENDS TO ADOPT THE AVOIDED COST<br>
<br>
CALCULATOR AND KILL ROOFTOP SOLAR IN SAN FRANCISCO.<br>
<br>
LOOK NO FURTHER THAN OUR NEIGHBORS OUTSIDE OF THE CITY<br>
<br>
WHERE IT'S ALREADY BEEN IMPLEMENTED F STOP SOLAR<br>
<br>
ADOPTION HAS EXPERIENCED A NEAR MARKET COLLAPSE IN CALIFORNIA<br>
<br>
OUTSIDE OF SAN FRANCISCO WE HAVE A CHOICE TO REJECT THIS<br>
<br>
MODEL AND REAFFIRM OUR VALUES. WE VALUE CLEAN LOCAL ENERGY.<br>
<br>
PLEASE REVIEW THE ESTABLISHED RECORD OF THE BOARD OF<br>
<br>
SUPERVISORS RESOLUTION 406 14 THE CLEAN POWER S.F.<br>
<br>
IMPLEMENTATION PLAN FROM 2015 AND S.F. ENVIRONMENTAL CODE<br>
<br>
SECTION 18.1 REJECT ANY COMPENSATION MODEL THAT USES<br>
<br>
THE AVOIDED COST CALCULATOR AND COMPENSATE SAN FRANCISCANS<br>
<br>
FOR THE FULL BENEFITS OF SOLAR POWER. THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR YOUR COMMENTS.<br>
<br>
>> WELCOME TO THE NEXT SPEAKER CHARLES ADDAMS ALBION POWER<br>
<br>
COMPANY IS A LOCAL BUSINESS. OVER THE PAST 20 YEARS WE'VE<br>
<br>
INSTALLED FEDERAL STATE RESIDENTIAL AND UTILITY SOLAR<br>
<br>
PROJECTS AND I WAS IN THE ROOM WHEN SOME OF YOUR PREDECESSORS<br>
<br>
WHEN CCAS WERE LEGISLATED. WE HAVE IMMENSE DISAPPOINTMENT<br>
<br>
IN CLEAN POWER S EFFORTS TO DESTROY LOCAL SOLAR BY DEVALUING RESIDENT PRODUCED SOLAR ENERGY WHILE SUBSCRIBING<br>
<br>
TO AN ENVIRONMENTALLY DESTRUCTIVE SHELL GAME CLEAN<br>
<br>
ENERGY MODEL FUNDED BY WALL STREET TAX EQUITY.<br>
<br>
THE CITY IS CURRENTLY DESTROYING ITS MAIN STREET<br>
<br>
GREEN ECONOMY AS INTENDED ROOFTOP SOLAR PRODUCES 100%<br>
<br>
LOCAL CLEAN ENERGY, LOCAL JOB CREATION, LOCAL TAX REVENUE<br>
<br>
FUNDED BY SAN FRANCISCANS USING THEIR OWN ROOFTOPS AND MONEY.<br>
<br>
ALL OF THE ENERGY CREATED IN SAN FRANCISCO STAYS IN SAN FRANCISCO IT IS LESS EXPENSIVE BUT CLEAN POWER S.F. MUST<br>
<br>
HONESTLY COMPENSATE THE RESIDENTS WHO PROVIDE THIS<br>
<br>
BENEFIT SFP P INSTEAD WANTS TO USE THE AC C CALCULATOR.<br>
<br>
THE P, G AND E DEVICE ASSUMING ALL CLEAN ENERGY IS PROVIDED<br>
<br>
CENTRALLY BY DECLARING LOCAL ENERGY LOCAL SMALL BUSINESS<br>
<br>
ENERGY EFFICIENCY AND ENVIRONMENTAL CONSERVATION<br>
<br>
AS A COST SHIFT TO THE POOR. THE PSEUDO ECONOMICS FAVORING<br>
<br>
CENTRALIZED POWER GENERATION THE COST PLUS 10% UTILITY<br>
<br>
INFRASTRUCTURE LOBBY HAS FUNDED A LOT OF STATE LEGISLATION OVER<br>
<br>
THE PAST TWO YEARS DISGUISING A LOT OF ENVIRONMENTAL DAMAGE<br>
<br>
AND INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS AS CLEAN ENERGY. SAN FRANCISCO COPYING THIS REGULATORY CAPTURE AGAINST<br>
<br>
LOCAL GENERATION IS A BETRAYAL OF EVERYTHING CCAS WERE CREATED<br>
<br>
TO CHAMPION. WE ARE NOT ASKING FOR SUBSIDIES<br>
<br>
WE'RE INSISTING CLEAN POWER S.F. PROVIDE AN HONEST<br>
<br>
ACCOUNTING OF THE BENEFITS OF LOCAL GENERATION ON ROOFTOPS BY<br>
<br>
RESIDENTS AND THE DBE BUILDING CODES CAN REALISTICALLY BE<br>
<br>
IMPLEMENTED IN AN URBAN ENVIRONMENT THOSE THINGS ARE<br>
<br>
NOT CURRENTLY HAPPENING. YOUR URGENT ATTENTION TO SFP<br>
<br>
C'S MISUNDERSTANDING IS GREATLY APPRECIATED. >> THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR YOUR COMMENTS.<br>
<br>
>> WELCOME TO THE NEXT SPEAKER. THANK YOU AND AS A GOV TV THANK<br>
<br>
YOU. REALLY HARD TO SEE THE EFFORTS<br>
<br>
THAT CAN YOU USE THE MICROPHONE PLEASE?<br>
<br>
THANK YOU. THIS IS PROBABLY HARD TO SEE.<br>
<br>
IT'S THE SAN FRANCISCO BUILDING CODE ORDINANCES THAT WERE<br>
<br>
PASSED BY THIS BOARD ON SOLAR PERMITTING AND INSPECTIONS<br>
<br>
AND THOSE ARE NOT BEING FOLLOWED RIGHT NOW.<br>
<br>
>> I'M JANINE COTTER. I'M CO-FOUNDER OF LUMINOL<br>
<br>
AND WE'VE BEEN INSTALLING SOLAR AND BATTERIES IN SAN FRANCISCO<br>
<br>
FOR 24 OVER 20 YEARS. I'M A RESIDENT OF DISTRICT FOUR<br>
<br>
AND LUMINOSITIES IN DISTRICT TEN.<br>
<br>
LUMINOL WAS SAN FRANCISCO'S FIRST WORKFORCE CERTIFIED GO<br>
<br>
SOLAR MYSELF INSTALLER SO WE HIRED FOLKS THROUGH THAT<br>
<br>
WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM AND I'M THE CHAIR OF SAN<br>
<br>
FRANCISCO'S WORKFORCE INVESTMENT BOARD AND ON JULY<br>
<br>
4TH TRUMP'S ONE BIG BEAUTIFUL BILL ELIMINATED THE 30% TAX<br>
<br>
CREDIT FOR SOLAR BATTERY INSTALLS AFTER THIS YEAR WE<br>
<br>
HAVE FIVE MONTHS. WE HAVE FIVE MONTHS.<br>
<br>
I CAME TODAY WITH THE SAN FRANCISCO SOLAR BATTERY<br>
<br>
COALITION WHICH IS COMPRISED OF LOCALLY OWNED SMALL BUSINESSES<br>
<br>
LIKE LUMINOL. AND WE HAVE THREE ISSUES OF<br>
<br>
REALLY EXCRUCIATING CONCERN TO US.<br>
<br>
ONE IS PERMITTING. THE OTHER IS INSPECTIONS<br>
<br>
AND THEN THERE'S CLEAN POWER AS JEFF'S PROPOSAL TO ADOPT<br>
<br>
GENIE'S NESE NET BILLING TARIFF AND UNDERVALUE SOLAR ENERGY<br>
<br>
GENERATED BY SAN FRANCISCANS, PERMITS USED TO BE PULLED<br>
<br>
ONLINE FOR MODEST SOLAR SYSTEMS AS PERMITS FOR LARGER SYSTEMS<br>
<br>
TOOK 3 TO 5 DAYS. >> THEY NOW TAKE 4 TO 8 WEEKS<br>
<br>
WITH OUTLIERS TAKING SIX OR MORE MONTHS.<br>
<br>
SOLAR APP AUTOMATIC AUTOMATED PERMITTING IS MORE RESTRICTIVE<br>
<br>
IN SAN FRANCISCO THAN ANY OTHER JURISDICTIONS.<br>
<br>
MOST OF OUR PROJECTS DON'T QUALIFY FOR SOLAR APP.<br>
<br>
I'M IN THE BUILDING CODE SECTION 106 8.1.15.6<br>
<br>
INSPECTIONS SAYS THAT ONLY ONE INSPECTION IS REQUIRED FOR MODESTLY SIZED SOLAR SYSTEMS BEGINNING IN OCTOBER OF 2020.<br>
<br>
>> THANK YOU MA'AM, FOR YOUR COMMENTS AND JUST FOR THOSE OF<br>
<br>
YOU WHO MIGHT NOT HAVE SPOKEN HERE BEFORE, I JUST WANT TO<br>
<br>
DRAW YOUR ATTENTION TO THE CLOCK ON THAT PODIUM.<br>
<br>
IT'LL LET YOU KNOW WHERE YOU'RE AT IN YOUR TWO MINUTES.<br>
<br>
>> THANK WELCOME. THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON, SUPERVISOR ZACH LIPTON.<br>
<br>
I'M ON THE STEERING COMMITTEE OF STREETS FOR ALL SAN<br>
<br>
FRANCISCO. >> MEMBER OF WALK S.F. AND I'M GLAD TO BE HERE TO SUPPORT SUPERVISOR MAL GARS STREET<br>
<br>
SAFETY ACT TRAFFIC SAFETY IS PUBLIC SAFETY.<br>
<br>
>> MORE PEOPLE ARE KILLED IN TRAFFIC VIOLENCE THAN HOMICIDES IN SAN FRANCISCO EVERY SINGLE YEAR.<br>
<br>
WE FOCUS A LOT ON THESE FATALITIES RIGHTFULLY BUT I<br>
<br>
ALSO WANT TO HIGHLIGHT THE SERIOUS INJURIES EVERY EIGHT<br>
<br>
HOURS. SOMEONE IS INJURED BADLY ENOUGH ON OUR STREETS TO NEED TO BE RUSHED TO THE TRAUMA CENTER AT<br>
<br>
S.F. GENERAL. THESE ARE OFTEN DEVASTATING<br>
<br>
AND LIFE CHANGING INJURIES AND YET THEY USUALLY GO WITHOUT<br>
<br>
A SINGLE MENTION IN THE PRESS AND NO RESPONSE FROM THE CITY. SO I'M GLAD THAT THIS MEASURE REAFFIRMS THE CITY'S COMMITMENT<br>
<br>
TO VISION ZERO. >> WHERE I'M CONCERNED IS THAT<br>
<br>
A LOT OF THIS IS NOT NEW. IT'S BEEN THE LAW IN THE CITY<br>
<br>
FOR MORE THAN 15 YEARS THAT ANY PUBLIC OR PRIVATE PROJECT ON<br>
<br>
THE RIGHT OF WAY HAS TO BE PART OF AN INTERAGENCY PROCESS TO<br>
<br>
MAKE SIGNIFICANT STREETSCAPE AND PEDESTRIAN SAFETY<br>
<br>
IMPROVEMENTS. THAT'S THE BETTER STREETS<br>
<br>
POLICY THIS BOARD ALREADY ENACTED. >> BUT IN PRACTICE THAT'S WORKED FOR MANY PRIVATE<br>
<br>
PROJECTS BUT RARELY EVER HAPPENS FOR PUBLIC PROJECTS.<br>
<br>
>> FOR EXAMPLE, THE CITY REPAVED 10TH STREET JUST A<br>
<br>
COUPLE OF BLOCKS FROM HERE LAST FALL. >> UTILITIES GOT UPGRADED, WE GOT NEW PAVEMENT AND THEN THE<br>
<br>
CREWS PUT THE STREET RIGHT BACK THE WAY IT WAS AND THE WAY IT<br>
<br>
WAS IS IS A SIX LANE WIDE SPEEDWAY TO A RESIDENTIAL<br>
<br>
NEIGHBORHOOD WITH AN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL AND THE HUMAN AGENCY<br>
<br>
HUMAN SERVICES SERVICE CENTER AND OTHER IMPORTANT CITY<br>
<br>
INSTITUTIONS. >> THIS WAS A MISSED<br>
<br>
OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE SAFETY IMPROVEMENTS AT VERY LITTLE<br>
<br>
COST WHILE THE STREET WAS BEING REPAVED ANYWAY. AND THAT HAPPENS ROUTINELY AROUND THE CITY.<br>
<br>
>> IT SHOULD BE AUTOMATIC TO MAKE THESE PROVEN LIFE SAVING<br>
<br>
IMPROVEMENTS WHENEVER A STREET IS BEING REPAVED.<br>
<br>
WHY DO WE EVEN HAVE A VISION ZERO TOOL KIT IF WE DON'T USE IT WHENEVER WE REPAVE OUR STREETS?<br>
<br>
>> WHY DID WE SPEND THE TIME AND MONEY TO CREATE A BIKING AND ROLLING PLAN IF WE DON'T IMPLEMENT IT WHEN STREETS ARE<br>
<br>
RENOVATED? I'M THANKFUL FOR SUPERVISOR<br>
<br>
MOGHERINI'S LONG TERM LEADERSHIP ON VISION ZERO<br>
<br>
AND LOOK FORWARD TO THE INTERAGENCY COORDINATION<br>
<br>
IN VITAL SAFETY IMPROVEMENTS THIS MEASURE WILL BRING. THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR YOUR COMMENTS.<br>
<br>
>> WELCOME TO THE NEXT SPEAKER. GOOD EVENING SUPERVISORS.<br>
<br>
MY NAME IS JEAN LAMB. I LIVE ON 18TH STREET NEAR<br>
<br>
GUERRERO AND I'M HERE TO SUPPORT SUPERVISOR MAL GARS<br>
<br>
PROPOSAL FOR SAFER STREETS. I'VE BEEN LIVING IN SAN FRANCISCO FOR 20 YEARS CAR FREE BIKING AND WALKING EVERYWHERE<br>
<br>
WHICH IS A WONDERFUL PRIVILEGE. I WAS LOOKING FORWARD TO GROWING OLD HERE AND BEING ABLE TO BE MOBILE AND I'VE JUST<br>
<br>
FOUND IT TO BE INCREASINGLY CHAOTIC, UNORGANIZED<br>
<br>
AND DANGEROUS TO WALK AND BIKE HERE TO THE POINT WHERE I HONESTLY FEEL LIKE I'M GOING TO BE KILLED ON MY BIKE IN THE<br>
<br>
BIKE LANE OR ON CROSSING A STREET.<br>
<br>
I CAN TELL YOU THAT I ROUTINELY AT INTERSECTIONS SEE CARS STOP<br>
<br>
AT A RED LIGHT AND THEN LOOK AROUND AND JUST DRIVE THROUGH<br>
<br>
IT OR THEY JUST ROLL THROUGH IT .<br>
<br>
>> I SEE CARS ROUTINELY MAKING RIGHT TURNS WHERE THEY COME<br>
<br>
RIGHT UP TO THE CROSSWALK AND HOVER AND DOG YOU UNTIL YOU<br>
<br>
GET OUT OF THEIR WAY SO THEY CAN MAKE THEIR TURN IN THE BIKE<br>
<br>
LANES. >> OF COURSE THERE'S CARS<br>
<br>
PARKED IN ALMOST EVERY BLOCK AT SOME TIMES A DAY WITH NO ONE<br>
<br>
IN THEM. THERE'S ALL THESE NEW USES NOW<br>
<br>
THAT HAVE COME OUT IN RECENT YEARS OF MOTORIZED SCOOTERS THAT ARE DELIVERING THINGS. THEY'RE SPEEDING IN THE BIKE<br>
<br>
LANE, PASSING ON THE RIDE, DOING UNEXPECTED ERRATIC THINGS<br>
<br>
. THERE'S STAND UP PEOPLE STANDING ON SCOOTERS, THERE'S SCOOTERS AND ELECTRIC BIKES ON<br>
<br>
THE SIDEWALKS WEAVING AMONG PEOPLE AND SOMETHING NEEDS TO<br>
<br>
BE DONE TO ORGANIZE THIS AND MAKE IT SAFER.<br>
<br>
AND AS THE GENTLEMAN BEFORE ME SAID, BESIDES THE SHOCKING<br>
<br>
STATISTICS OF FATALITIES, IT'S ROUTINELY PEOPLE ARE HIT<br>
<br>
AND MAKE ARMED AND INJURED AND PLEASE SUPPORT SUPERVISOR<br>
<br>
MEL GARS PROPOSAL. THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR YOUR COMMENTS. >> LET'S HEAR FROM OUR NEXT<br>
<br>
SPEAKER. WELCOME.<br>
<br>
>> HI EVERYONE. MY NAME IS AUDREY. I'M A RESIDENT OF DISTRICT ONE. I APPRECIATE AND IN IN STRONG<br>
<br>
SUPPORT OF SUPERVISOR MEL GUY'S RESOLUTION FOR A CITYWIDE<br>
<br>
TRAFFIC SAFETY COMMITMENT. NOW MORE THAN EVER OUR CITY<br>
<br>
MUST DOUBLE DOWN ON VISION AND OUR VISION ZERO GOALS 2024<br>
<br>
HAD THE HIGHEST NUMBER OF TRAFFIC DEATHS IN RECENT MEMORY<br>
<br>
WHERE 40 PEOPLE WERE KILLED IN TRAFFIC CRASHES INCLUDING A<br>
<br>
72 YEAR OLD NEIGHBOR IN MY NEIGHBORHOOD THE RICHMOND ON FULTON ON FEBRUARY. AND THIS IS TO SAY NOTHING<br>
<br>
ABOUT THE HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE WHO ARE MAIMED EACH YEAR ON OUR<br>
<br>
STREETS. >> OF COURSE NOBODY WANTS TO<br>
<br>
SEE OUR FELLOW NEIGHBORS KILLED OR HURT.<br>
<br>
BUT I HOPE THAT THIS RESOLUTION NOT ONLY GIVES US<br>
<br>
ACCOUNTABILITY BUT OUR LEADERS THE POLITICAL COURAGE NEEDED TO<br>
<br>
IMPLEMENT THESE CHANGES. WE MUST IMPLEMENT PROVEN<br>
<br>
SYSTEMIC SOLUTIONS LIKE COMPLETE STREETS, LOWER SPEED<br>
<br>
LIMITS EVEN IN THE FACE OF OPPOSITION.<br>
<br>
WHILE POLICE ENFORCEMENT IS IMPORTANT, IT'S NOT A REPLACEMENT FOR THESE CHANGES. ULTIMATELY WE MUST CHANGE THE<br>
<br>
PHYSICAL LAYOUT OF OUR CITY OUR TRAFFIC RULES AND HOW WE GET<br>
<br>
AROUND. WE CANNOT ACHIEVE VISION ZERO<br>
<br>
WITHOUT THEM. >> THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR YOUR COMMENTS. >> WELCOME TO THE NEXT SPEAKER<br>
<br>
. GOOD EVENING SUPERVISORS. MY NAME IS CYRUS HALL. I APOLOGIZE IF MY VOICE IS HOARSE. I NEED WATER TONIGHT I AM<br>
<br>
SPEAKING AS A MEMBER OF STREETS FOR ALL SAN FRANCISCO AND THE<br>
<br>
STREETS FOR ALL STEERING COMMITTEE STREETS FOR ALL<br>
<br>
SUPPORTS THE INTENT AND DIRECTION OF THE SAN FRANCISCO STREETS SAFETY ACT AND DEEPLY APPRECIATE<br>
<br>
SUPERVISOR MEL GA'S LEADERSHIP IN INTRODUCING THIS RESOLUTION<br>
<br>
. AND AS SAN FRANCISCO DISCUSSES HOW TO MOVE FORWARD ON VISION ZERO, WE WELCOME THE<br>
<br>
RESOLUTION'S FOCUS ON A PREVENTATIVE INTER-AGENCY DATA<br>
<br>
DRIVEN APPROACH TO ENDING TRAFFIC VIOLENCE.<br>
<br>
STREETS FOR ALL RESPECTFULLY URGES THAT THE RESOLUTION OFFER<br>
<br>
A CLEAR DIRECTIVE TO IMPLEMENT VISION ZERO SAFETY MEASURES<br>
<br>
SUCH AS PROTECTED BIKE LANES DURING REPAVING AND STREET<br>
<br>
RECONSTRUCTION PROJECTS ON ALL STREETS.<br>
<br>
>> THIS IS CONSISTENT WITH BOTH THE BETTER STREETS PLAN AND THE CITY'S BIKING AND ROLLING PLAN. WHEN REPAVING, RECONSTRUCTING<br>
<br>
OR CONDUCTING OTHER STREET LEVEL WORK ALL RECOMMENDED<br>
<br>
SAFETY INFRASTRUCTURE IMPROVEMENTS SHOULD BE DESIGNED<br>
<br>
AND CONSTRUCTED. THESE INCLUDE SEPARATED<br>
<br>
AND PROTECTED BIKE LANES AS OUTLINED IN THE BIKING AND ROLLING PLAN AS WELL AS CURB EXTENSIONS AS TRAFFIC<br>
<br>
CALMING AND HARDENED DAYLIGHTING.<br>
<br>
>> A STRONG RESOLUTION REAFFIRMING THE BOARD'S 2010<br>
<br>
DETERMINATIONS AND THE BETTER STREETS PLAN WILL INDICATE INDICATE CLEAR SUPPORT FOR MULTIPLE USES OF STREETS<br>
<br>
INCLUDING SAFE ACTIVE AND AMPLE SPACE FOR PEDESTRIANS, BICYCLES<br>
<br>
AND PUBLIC TRANSIT. SAFE STREETS WITH DIVERSE<br>
<br>
TRANSPORTATION MODES ARE MORE CONDUCIVE TO DIVERSE PUBLIC<br>
<br>
LIFE AND THE EFFICIENT MOVEMENT OF PEOPLE AND GOODS THAN<br>
<br>
STREETS DESIGNED PRIMARILY TO MOVE AUTOMOBILES. LET'S WORK TOGETHER TO DESIGN AND PASS THE STRONGEST<br>
<br>
RESOLUTION POSSIBLE. >> THANK YOU SO MUCH.<br>

<br>
FIRST OF ALL, THERE ARE MORE PEOPLE WALKING DOGS.<br>
<br>
SECONDLY, THERE ARE MORE PEOPLE PUSHING BABY CARRIAGES.<br>
<br>
AND THIRD THERE ARE MORE CARS IGNORING STOP SIGNS SPEED ING<br>
<br>
AND ENTERING IN CROSSWALKS WHEN PEDESTRIANS ARE IN THE<br>
<br>
CROSSWALKS. I DON'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENED DURING COVID BUT DRIVING GOT CRAZIER AND NOW I'VE NOTICED<br>
<br>
IT'S MUCH MUCH MORE DANGEROUS TO WALK AROUND IN THE RICHMOND<br>
<br>
DISTRICT. THEREFORE I STRONGLY URGE YOU<br>

<br>
CHAMPION AND REALLY DOING IMPORTANT STUFF.<br>
<br>
I'M NOT GOING TO GO INTO THE NUMBER OF MISSED RED LIGHTS<br>

ACTUAL PHYSICAL IMPACT BUT IT'S BEEN EXCEEDINGLY CLOSE ON<br>
<br>
OCCASION. SO I'M REALLY GLAD TO SEE THE<br>
<br>
CALLING OUT THE RESPONSIBILITIES FOR THE VARIOUS AGENCIES. AND HOPEFULLY THAT WILL HAVE A<br>
<br>
SIGNIFICANT IMPACT THAT COORDINATION AMONG AGENCIES IS<br>
<br>

LOOKING FORWARD TO SEEING IT MOVE FORWARD AND GETTING ACTION FROM THE RELEVANT DEPARTMENTS TONIGHT.<br>
<br>

<br>
>> I'M HARRY ROWE AND I'M HOPING TO GIVE YOU A LITTLE COMIC RELIEF AT LEAST TO EVEN LOOK AT YOU IN PERSON AND SAY<br>
<br>
HELLO. THANK YOU SUPERVISOR MELGAR FOR<br>
<br>
TACKLING THIS ONE. HIS SUPER THE VISION ZERO THAT<br>
<br>
RAN OUT LAST YEAR NEEDED TO BE REDO REDONE BECAUSE THE TRAFFIC<br>
<br>
THING HAS GOTTEN OUT OF HAND. I'VE SEEN LEFT TURNS WHERE THERE'S MANY LEFT TURN SIGNS. TODAY I WAS ON FULTON STREET AT<br>
<br>
25 MILE AN HOUR LIST WHICH STREET I WAS GOING 30 DON'T<br>
<br>
TELL THE POLICE AND CARS WERE PASSING ME AND I HAD AN SUV ON<br>
<br>
MY BEHIND BECAUSE I WAS GOING TO SLOW AT FIVE MILES OVER THE<br>
<br>
SPEED LIMIT. I WAS IN A CROSSWALK THE OTHER<br>
<br>
DAY AND AS I WAS CROSSING A CAR THAT WANTED TO MAKE A RIGHT<br>
<br>
TURN ON THE RED LIGHT ALL LEGAL BUT PULLS INTO THE CROSSWALK<br>
<br>
IN FRONT OF ME TWO FEET AWAY FROM ME. I HAD TO STOP BACK UP, GO AROUND THE CAR.<br>
<br>
>> IT WAS A WAYMO SELF-DRIVING CAR.<br>
<br>
I MEAN THEY'RE NOT EVEN PROGRAMED TO PAY ATTENTION.<br>
<br>
SO THE CITY HAS GOTTEN REALLY CRAZY. I'M 80. I'VE BEEN HERE SINCE 70.<br>
<br>
THAT'S 50 YEARS. IT'S GOTTEN WORSE AND WORSE<br>
<br>
AND WORSE. PLEASE DO EVERYTHING YOU CAN TO<br>
<br>
GET IT BACK. LIVING THE REST OF MY LIFE OR<br>
<br>
ANYONE HAVING TO BE ON CRUTCHES OR IN A WHEELCHAIR OR IN A<br>
<br>
COFFIN IS NOT THE WAY SAN FRANCISCO SHOULD RESPOND TO<br>
<br>
WHAT'S GOING ON IN THE TRAFFIC HERE.<br>
<br>
>> WE HAD A PERIOD WHERE WE DOUBLED DOWN ON DOUBLE PARKING<br>
<br>
A FEW YEARS AGO MAYBE BEFORE SOME OF YOU WERE AROUND<br>
<br>
AND THAT WORKED. WE GOT THE DOUBLE PARKING TO STOP. WHY CAN'T A TRUCK THAT'S<br>
<br>
DELIVERING SOMETHING PULL INTO AN EMPTY SPOT SOMEWHERE BECAUSE<br>
<br>
THEY DON'T WANT TO WALK EXTRA STEPS SO THEY PARK RIGHT IN THE<br>
<br>
STREET AND STOP. SOMETHING'S GOT TO BE DONE.<br>
<br>
THANK YOU, SUPERVISOR MELGAR, THANK ALL OF YOU FOR YOUR JOBS<br>
<br>
AND FOR WHAT YOU'RE DOING. >> I KNOW YOU'RE HEARING THIS.<br>
<br>
THANK YOU FOR YOUR COMMENTS. >> WELCOME TO THE NEXT SPEAKER<br>
<br>
. >> GOOD EVENING. BOARD PRESIDENT MANDEL MEN AND SUPERVISORS.<br>
<br>
MY NAME IS MARTA LINDSEY. I'M THE COMMUNICATIONS DIRECTOR<br>
<br>
AT WALK SAN FRANCISCO WHICH ADVOCATES EVERY DAY FOR PEDESTRIANS IN OUR CITY. I'M HERE TO REALLY, REALLY<br>
<br>
THANK SUPERVISOR MELGAR FOR INTRODUCING THE STREET SAFETY<br>
<br>
ACT TONIGHT. >> I AM LOOKING AT A BOARD OF<br>
<br>
SUPERVISORS WHO REALLY GETS WHY THIS RESOLUTION IS SO NEEDED.<br>
<br>
YOU'VE SUPPORTED SPEED CAMERAS. YOU'VE LEGISLATED FOR<br>
<br>
DAYLIGHTING TO BE PAINTED ACROSS YOUR DISTRICT AND YOU'VE PUSHED FOR THE SPEED TO GET BACK IN THE GAME OF TRAFFIC<br>
<br>
ENFORCEMENT. >> I KNOW YOU'RE HEARING FROM<br>
<br>
CONSTITUENTS WHO FEEL LIKE IT'S THE WILD WEST OUT THERE AND NO<br>
<br>
MATTER WHAT PART OF THE CITY YOU REPRESENT, YOU KNOW THAT SENIORS AND CHILDREN ARE WAY TOO VULNERABLE GETTING AROUND<br>
<br>
AND YOU DO NOT WANT TO GET THAT TEXT OR PHONE CALL SAYING THAT<br>
<br>
SOMEONE HAS BEEN KILLED IN YOUR DISTRICT.<br>
<br>
>> SUPERVISOR MEL GARS RESOLUTION REAFFIRMS SAN<br>
<br>
FRANCISCO'S PRIOR VISION ZERO COMMITMENT TO END SEVERE AND FATAL CRASHES AND THIS IS CRUCIAL.<br>
<br>
WITHOUT THIS FUNDAMENTAL COMMITMENT AS A CITY, TRAFFIC<br>
<br>
SAFETY WILL NOT BE PRIORITIZED .<br>
<br>
IT'S THAT SIMPLE AND ZERO IS STILL AND ALWAYS WILL BE THE<br>
<br>
RIGHT GOAL. SO I REALLY WANT TO THANK SUPERVISOR MELGAR FOR REAFFIRMING SAN FRANCISCO AS A<br>
<br>
VISION ZERO CITY. >> BUT SUPERVISOR MELGAR<br>
<br>
RESOLUTION INCLUDES A LOT MORE AS A SUITE OF TARGETED ACTIONS<br>
<br>
FOR KEY AGENCIES TO DO A LOT MORE TO DESIGN AND ENFORCE OUR<br>
<br>
STREETS FOR SAFETY. THIS IS EVERYTHING FROM LEADING<br>
<br>
INTO AUTOMATED ENFORCEMENT REFORMING THE RESIDENTIAL<br>
<br>
TRAFFIC CALMING PROGRAM REQUIRING THAT STREETS ARE LEFT<br>
<br>
BETTER THAN THEY WERE FOUND WHEN THEY ARE PAINTED OR PAVED AND BY BETTER I MEAN A WHOLE LOT SAFER.<br>
<br>
AND THERE'S A LOT OF RED TAPE CUTTING SO THAT STREET SAFETY<br>
<br>
PROJECTS CAN HAPPEN FASTER BECAUSE WE NEED THEM TO HAPPEN<br>
<br>
SO MUCH FASTER. SO WITH THE STREET SAFETY ACT<br>
<br>
YOU ALL CAN DO WHAT I KNOW YOU WANT TO DO SAVE LIVES AND SHOW<br>
<br>
THAT SAN FRANCISCO CAN LEAD ON AN ISSUE THAT AFFECTS EVERYONE<br>
<br>
EVERY DAY IN OUR CITY. THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR YOUR COMMENTS. WELCOME TO THE NEXT SPEAKER.<br>
<br>
>> I LOST MY FOURTH JOB IN SIX MONTHS THIS PAST FRIDAY.<br>
<br>
IT'S NEVER A PERFORMANCE ISSUE BUT A DISCRIMINATE TORY ONE I'M<br>
<br>
GIVEN LOOKS OF INFERIORITY WHEN OTHERS LEARN I'M ON PROBATION<br>
<br>
JUST AS I WILL TODAY OTHERS TO IGNORE THEIR OWN CRIMES BEING<br>
<br>
ACTIVELY COMMITTED NO MATTER HOW MINIMAL OR EXTREME TO FACE<br>
<br>
NO CONSEQUENCE AS THE ONES WITH MORE MONEY NEVER DO. WHILE REGULARLY DENYING DUE WAGES AMONG OTHER CRIMES OF<br>
<br>
INTENT RATHER THAN OVERREACTION, I WAS TOLD I WAS<br>
<br>
ANNOYING THIS WEEKEND I'VE ANNOYED A LOT OF PEOPLE THAT<br>
<br>
PERMIT ABUSE AND DISCRIMINATION BUT THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THEM<br>
<br>
AND MYSELF IS I DO NOT PERMIT IT NOR DO I REGULARLY ATTEMPT<br>
<br>
TO DENY OTHERS THEIR FREEDOMS WHILE CONTINUING TO FORCED<br>
<br>
CONTINUING A FORCED EXPERIENCE. THEY NEVER LET YOU ESCAPE TO<br>
<br>
ANYONE THAT MIGHT FIND THIS REALITY ANNOYING.<br>
<br>
LET YOURSELF UNDERSTAND YOU ARE NO BETTER. I FIND IT ANNOYING BEING STRANGLED FOR 35 MINUTES<br>
<br>
AND HAVING A FEMALE TELLING ME I SHOULD HAVE LEARNED FROM IT.<br>
<br>
I FIND IT ANNOYING HAVING TO SPEND FOUR MONTHS IN CUSTODY<br>
<br>
FOR TAKING DOWN A CURTAIN STABLE TO THE WALL WITH FECES<br>
<br>
ON IT. MY SLUMLORDS CALLED ME A FREELOADING DRUG ADDICT AS I WAS DENIED DUE WAGES BY TWO<br>
<br>
MORE THAT I WON'T TELL YOU THEIR RACE BECAUSE IT'S NOT A<br>
<br>
RACE ISSUE THAT MANY OF YOU ATTEMPT TO MAKE EVERY ISSUE<br>
<br>
IT'S A DENIAL OF RIGHTS ISSUE MOST OFTEN FORCED BY MANY THAT<br>
<br>
DON'T LIVE HERE. BUT PLEASE DON'T DISREGARD I'VE LONG UNDERSTOOD THERE BEING IN EVERY RACE.<br>
<br>
I FIND IT ANNOYING HAVING OTHERS SEEK THE ARREST OF<br>
<br>
CITIZENS FOR LEGALLY PROTECTED RIGHTS WHILE THEY SHUT DOWN<br>
<br>
BRIDGES FOR FOREIGN LANDS AND WANT TO SAY YOU BUT<br>
<br>
ATTEMPT TO HOLD YOU CRIMINALS SHOULD YOU SAY YOU BACK THAT<br>
<br>
HAPPENED THIS WEEKEND AND MORE THAN ONE MEMBER OF THE BOARD HAS USED FOUL LANGUAGE UNABLE TO CONTROL THEIR QUOTE UNQUOTE<br>
<br>
UNHINGED BEHAVIOR AS I'M TOLD TO HAVE.<br>
<br>
SHOULD I USE THE SAME WORDS WHILE NOT EARNING $160,000 A<br>
<br>
YEAR BUT EXPERIENCING CONTINUED DISCRIMINATORY PROSECUTION<br>
<br>
AND EXPECTATION? YES, I AM REPEATING MUCH OF THE<br>
<br>
SAME BUT THE SAME HAS YET TO CHANGE AS OUR SUICIDE RATE<br>

CONTINUES TO INCREASE. I'M NOT CLAIMING PERFECT ACTION<br>
